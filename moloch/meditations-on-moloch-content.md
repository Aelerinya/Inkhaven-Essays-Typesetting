**I.**

Allen Ginsberg's famous poem on Moloch:

> What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up
> their brains and imagination?
>
> Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars!
> Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old
> men weeping in the parks!
>
> Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental
> Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!
>
> Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless
> jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are
> judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned
> governments!
>
> Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running
> money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a
> cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!
>
> Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose
> skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch
> whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks
> and antennae crown the cities!
>
> Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is
> electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius!
> Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is
> the Mind!
>
> Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in
> Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!
>
> Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness
> without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy!
> Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the
> sky!
>
> Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton
> treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations!
> invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!
>
> They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees,
> radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is
> everywhere about us!
>
> Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the
> American river!
>
> Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of
> sensitive bullshit!
>
> Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the
> flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years' animal screams and
> suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!
>
> Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the
> holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude!
> waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

What's always impressed me about this poem is its conception of
civilization as an individual entity. You can almost see him, with his
fingers of armies and his skyscraper-window eyes.

A lot of the commentators say Moloch represents capitalism. This is
definitely a piece of it, even a big piece. But it doesn't quite fit.
Capitalism, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen? Capitalism in
whom I am a consciousness without a body? Capitalism, therefore granite
cocks?

Moloch is introduced as the answer to a question -- C. S. Lewis'
question in [Hierarchy Of
Philosophers](http://www.moronail.net/img/1392_lil_jon_philosophy_what)
-- *what does it*? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise.
Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and
aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?

And Ginsberg answers: *Moloch does it.*

There's [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the
*Principia Discordia* where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about
the evils of human society. "Everyone is hurting each other, the planet
is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own
people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war."

The Goddess answers: "What is the matter with that, if it's what you
want to do?"

Malaclypse: "But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!"

Goddess: "Oh. Well, then stop."

The implicit question is -- if everyone hates the current system, who
perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: "Moloch". It's powerful not
because it's correct -- nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian
demon causes everything -- but because thinking of the system as an
agent throws into relief the degree to which the system *isn't* an
agent.

Bostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a
dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the
leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It's easy
enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first,
every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong
electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including
this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all
citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were
well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be
enforced.

So you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you
don't everyone else will kill you, because if they don't, everyone else
will kill *them*, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but
for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a
god's-eye-view, we can optimize the system to "everyone agrees to stop
doing this at once", but no one within the system is able to effect the
transition without great risk to themselves.

And okay, this example is kind of contrived. So let's run through --
let's say ten -- real world examples of similar multipolar traps to
really hammer in how important this is.

[1. The Prisoner's Dilemma]{.underline}, as played by two very dumb
libertarians who keep ending up on defect-defect. There's a much better
outcome available if they could figure out the coordination, but
coordination is *hard*. From a god's-eye-view, we can agree that
cooperate-cooperate is a better outcome than defect-defect, but neither
prisoner within the system can make it happen.

[2. Dollar auctions]{.underline}. I wrote about this and even more
convoluted versions of the same principle in [Game Theory As A Dark
Art](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr9/game_theory_as_a_dark_art/). Using some
[weird auction rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction), you
can take advantage of poor coordination to make someone pay \$10 for a
one dollar bill. From a god's-eye-view, clearly people should not pay
\$10 for a on-er. From within the system, each individual step taken
might be rational.

*(Ashcans and unobtainable dollars!)*

[3. The fish farming story]{.underline} from my [Non-Libertarian FAQ
2.0](http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html):

> As a thought experiment, let's consider aquaculture (fish farming) in
> a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a
> thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of
> \$1000/month. For a while, all is well.
>
> But each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake.
> Let's say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower
> productivity in the lake by \$1/month.
>
> A thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by
> \$1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money.
> Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a complex filtering system
> that removes waste products. It costs \$300/month to operate. All fish
> farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms
> are now making a profit of \$700/month -- still a respectable sum.
>
> But one farmer (let's call him Steve) gets tired of spending the money
> to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting
> the lake, lowering productivity by \$1. Steve earns \$999 profit, and
> everyone else earns \$699 profit.
>
> Everyone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are,
> because he's not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They
> disconnect their filters too.
>
> Once four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning
> \$600/month -- less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept
> their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making
> \$300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying "Wait! We all need to
> make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone's
> productivity goes down."
>
> Everyone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except
> one person who is sort of a jerk. Let's call him Mike. Now everyone is
> back using filters again, except Mike. Mike earns \$999/month, and
> everyone else earns \$699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they
> too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter
> for \$300 extra profit...
>
> A self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A
> self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make
> everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to
> wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This
> can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such
> a pact.

The more I think about it, the more I feel like this is the core of my
objection to libertarianism, and that Non-Libertarian FAQ 3.0 will just
be this one example copy-pasted two hundred times. From a
god's-eye-view, we can say that polluting the lake leads to bad
consequences. From within the system, no individual can prevent the lake
from being polluted, and buying a filter might not be such a good idea.

[4. The Malthusian trap]{.underline}, at least at its extremely pure
theoretical limits. Suppose you are one of the first rats introduced
onto a pristine island. It is full of yummy plants and you live an
idyllic life lounging about, eating, and composing great works of art
(you're one of those rats from [*The Rats of
NIMH*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689710682/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0689710682&linkCode=as2&tag=slastacod-20&linkId=BRZZD37E45RNQI3R)![](https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=slastacod-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0689710682){decoding="async"
width="1" height="1" border="0"
style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"}).

You live a long life, mate, and have a dozen children. All of them have
a dozen children, and so on. In a couple generations, the island has ten
thousand rats and has reached its carrying capacity. Now there's not
enough food and space to go around, and a certain percent of each new
generation dies in order to keep the population steady at ten thousand.

A certain sect of rats abandons art in order to devote more of their
time to scrounging for survival. Each generation, a bit less of this
sect dies than members of the mainstream, until after a while, no rat
composes any art at all, and any sect of rats who try to bring it back
will go extinct within a few generations.

In fact, it's not just art. Any sect at all that is leaner, meaner, and
more survivalist than the mainstream will eventually take over. If one
sect of rats altruistically decides to limit its offspring to two per
couple in order to decrease overpopulation, that sect will die out,
swarmed out of existence by its more numerous enemies. If one sect of
rats starts practicing cannibalism, and finds it gives them an advantage
over their fellows, it will eventually take over and reach fixation.

If some rat scientists predict that depletion of the island's nut stores
is accelerating at a dangerous rate and they will soon be exhausted
completely, a few sects of rats might try to limit their nut consumption
to a sustainable level. Those rats will be outcompeted by their more
selfish cousins. Eventually the nuts will be exhausted, most of the rats
will die off, and the cycle will begin again. Any sect of rats
advocating some action to stop [the
cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_cycle) will be
outcompeted by their cousins for whom advocating *anything* is a waste
of time that could be used to compete and consume.

For a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as the ideal
case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other things
to see the underlying mechanism. From a god's-eye-view, it's easy to say
the rats should maintain a comfortably low population. From within the
system, each individual rat will follow its genetic imperative and the
island will end up in an endless boom-bust cycle.

[5. Capitalism]{.underline}. Imagine a capitalist in a cutthroat
industry. He employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he
sells at minimal profit. Maybe he would like to pay his workers more, or
give them nicer working conditions. But he can't, because that would
raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his
cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people
who would like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind
of ironclad guarantee that none of them are going to defect by
undercutting their prices they can't do it.

Like the rats, who gradually lose all values except sheer competition,
so companies in an economic environment of *sufficiently intense
competition* are forced to abandon all values except
optimizing-for-profit or else be outcompeted by companies that optimized
for profit better and so can sell the same service at a lower price.

(I'm not really sure how widely people appreciate the value of
analogizing capitalism to evolution. Fit companies -- defined as those
that make the customer want to buy from them -- survive, expand, and
inspire future efforts, and unfit companies -- defined as those no one
wants to buy from -- go bankrupt and die out along with their [company
DNA](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-your-company-dna-2011-2).
The reasons Nature is red and tooth and claw are the same reasons the
market is ruthless and exploitative)

From a god's-eye-view, we can contrive a friendly industry where every
company pays its workers a living wage. From within the system, there's
no way to enact it.

running money!)*

[6. [The Two-Income
Trap](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/28/book-review-the-two-income-trap/)]{.underline},
as recently discussed on this blog. It theorized that sufficiently
intense competition for suburban houses in good school districts meant
that people had to throw away lots of other values -- time at home with
their children, financial security -- to optimize for
house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.

From a god's-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to
help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get
exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have to work one
job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to
ban second jobs, everyone who doesn't get one will be left behind.

*(Robot apartments! Invisible suburbs!)*

[7. Agriculture]{.underline}. Jared Diamond calls it [the worst mistake
in human
history](http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race).
Whether or not it was a mistake, it wasn't an *accident* -- agricultural
civilizations simply outcompeted nomadic ones, inevitable and
irresistably. Classic Malthusian trap. Maybe hunting-gathering was more
enjoyable, higher life expectancy, and more conducive to human
flourishing -- but in a state of *sufficiently intense competition*
between peoples, in which agriculture with all its disease and
oppression and pestilence was the more competitive option, everyone will
end up agriculturalists or [go the way of the Comanche
Indians](http://squid314.livejournal.com/340809.html).

From a god's-eye-view, it's easy to see everyone should keep the more
enjoyable option and stay hunter-gatherers. From within the system, each
individual tribe only faces the choice of going agricultural or
inevitably dying.

[8. Arms races]{.underline}. Large countries can spend anywhere from 5%
to 30% of their budget on defense. In the absence of war -- a condition
which has mostly held for the past fifty years -- all this does is sap
money away from infrastructure, health, education, or economic growth.
But any country that fails to spend enough money on defense risks being
invaded by a neighboring country that did. Therefore, almost all
countries try to spend some money on defense.

From a god's-eye-view, the best solution is world peace and no country
having an army at all. From within the system, no country can
unilaterally enforce that, so their best option is to keep on throwing
their money into missiles that lie in silos unused.

*(Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies!)*

[9. Cancer]{.underline}. The human body is supposed to be made up of
cells living harmoniously and pooling their resources for the greater
good of the organism. If a cell defects from this equilibrium by
investing its resources into copying itself, it and its descendants will
flourish, eventually outcompeting all the other cells and taking over
the body -- at which point it dies. Or the situation may repeat, with
certain cancer cells defecting against the rest of the tumor, thus
slowing down its growth and causing the tumor to stagnate.

From a god's-eye-view, the best solution is all cells cooperating so
that they don't all die. From within the system, cancerous cells will
proliferate and outcompete the other -- so that only the existence of
the immune system keeps the natural incentive to turn cancerous in
check.

[10. The "race to the bottom"]{.underline} describes [a political
situation where](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom) some
jurisdictions lure businesses by promising lower taxes and fewer
regulations. The end result is that either everyone optimizes for
competitiveness -- by having minimal tax rates and regulations -- or
they lose all of their business, revenue, and jobs to people who did (at
which point they are pushed out and replaced by a government who will be
more compliant).

But even though the last one has stolen the name, all these scenarios
are in fact a race to the bottom. Once one agent learns how to become
more competitive by sacrificing a common value, all its competitors must
also sacrifice that value or be outcompeted and replaced by the less
scrupulous. Therefore, the system is likely to end up with everyone once
again equally competitive, but the sacrificed value is gone forever.
From a god's-eye-view, the competitors know they will all be worse off
if they defect, but from within the system, given insufficient
coordination it's impossible to avoid.

Before we go on, there's a slightly different form of multi-agent trap
worth investigating. In this one, the competition is kept at bay by some
outside force -- usually social stigma. As a result, there's not
actually a race to the bottom -- the system can continue functioning at
a relatively high level -- but it's impossible to optimize and resources
are consistently thrown away for no reason. Lest you get exhausted
before we even begin, I'll limit myself to four examples here.

[11. Education]{.underline}. In my essay on reactionary philosophy, I
talk about my frustration with education reform:

> People ask why we can't reform the education system. But right now
> students' incentive is to go to the most prestigious college they can
> get into so employers will hire them -- whether or not they learn
> anything. Employers' incentive is to get students from the most

> their boss if it goes wrong -- whether or not the college provides
> value added. And colleges' incentive is to do whatever it takes to get
> more prestige, as measured in *US News and World Report* rankings --
> whether or not it helps students. Does this lead to huge waste and
> poor education? Yes. Could the Education God notice this and make some
> Education Decrees that lead to a vastly more efficient system? Easily!
> But since there's no Education God everybody is just going to follow
> their own incentives, which are only partly correlated with education
> or efficiency.

From a god's eye view, it's easy to say things like "Students should
only go to college if they think they will get something out of it, and
employers should hire applicants based on their competence and not on
what college they went to". From within the system, everyone's already
following their own incentives correctly, so unless the incentives
change the system won't either.

[12. Science]{.underline}. Same essay:

> The modern research community *knows* they aren't producing the best
> science they could be. There's lots of publication bias, statistics
> are done in a confusing and misleading way out of sheer inertia, and
> replications often happen very late or not at all. And sometimes

[13. Government corruption]{.underline}. I don't know of anyone who
really thinks, in a principled way, that corporate welfare is a good
idea. But the government still manages to spend somewhere around
(depending on how you calculate it) \$100 billion dollars a year on it
-- which for example is three times the amount they spend on health care
for the needy. Everyone familiar with the problem has come up with the
same easy solution: stop giving so much corporate welfare. Why doesn't
it happen?

Government are competing against one another to get elected or promoted.
And suppose part of optimizing for electability is optimizing campaign
donations from corporations -- or maybe [it
isn't](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/19/plutocracy-isnt-about-money/),
but officials *think* it is. Officials who try to mess with corporate
welfare may lose the support of corporations and be outcompeted by
officials who promise to keep it intact.

So although from a god's-eye-view everyone knows that eliminating
corporate welfare is the best solution, each individual official's
personal incentives push her to maintain it.

[14. Congress]{.underline}. Only 9% of Americans like it, suggesting a
[lower approval rating
than](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-somewhere-below-cockroaches-traffic-jams-and-nickleback-in-americans-esteem.html)
cockroaches, head lice, or traffic jams. However, [62% of
people](http://www.gallup.com/poll/162362/americans-down-congress-own-representative.aspx)
who know who their own Congressional representative is approve of them.
In theory, it should be *really hard* to have a democratically elected
body that maintains a 9% approval rating for more than one election
cycle. In practice, every representative's incentive is to appeal to his
or her constituency while throwing the rest of the country under the bus
-- something at which they apparently succeed.

From a god's-eye-view, every Congressperson ought to think only of the
good of the nation. From within the system, you do what gets you
elected.

**II.**

A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some
competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other
value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who
don't take it die out. Eventually, everyone's relative status is about
the same as before, but everyone's absolute status is worse than before.
The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have
been -- in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out
a way to make things any worse.

In a sufficiently intense competition (1-10), everyone who doesn't throw
all their values under the bus dies out -- think of the poor rats who
wouldn't stop making art. This is the infamous Malthusian trap, where
everyone is reduced to "subsistence".

In an insufficiently intense competition (11-14), all we see is a
perverse failure to optimize -- consider the journals which can't switch
to more reliable science, or the legislators who can't get their act
together and eliminate corporate welfare. It may not reduce people to
subsistence, but there is a weird sense in which it takes away their
free will.

Every two-bit author and philosopher has to write their own utopia. Most
of them are legitimately pretty nice. In fact, it's a pretty good bet
that two utopias that are polar opposites both sound better than our own
world.

It's kind of embarrassing that random nobodies can think up states of
affairs better than the one we actually live in. And in fact most of
them can't. A lot of utopias sweep the hard problems under the rug, or
would fall apart in ten minutes if actually implemented.

But let me suggest a couple of "utopias" that don't have this problem.

-- The utopia where instead of the government paying lots of corporate
welfare, the government *doesn't* pay lots of corporate welfare.

-- The utopia where every country's military is 50% smaller than it is
today, and the savings go into infrastructure spending.

-- The utopia where all hospitals use the same electronic medical record
system, or at least medical record systems that can talk to each other,
so that doctors can look up what the doctor you saw last week in a
different hospital decided instead of running all the same tests over
again for \$5000.

I don't think there are too many people who *oppose* any of these
utopias. If they're not happening, it's not because people don't support
them. It certainly isn't because nobody's thought of them, since I just
thought of them right now and I don't expect my "discovery" to be hailed
as particularly novel or change the world.

Any human with above room temperature IQ can design a utopia. The reason
our current system isn't a utopia is that *it wasn't designed by
humans*. Just as you can look at an arid terrain and determine what
shape a river will one day take by assuming water will obey gravity, so
you can look at a civilization and determine what shape its institutions
will one day take by assuming people will obey incentives.

But that means that just as the shapes of rivers are not designed for
beauty or navigation, but rather an artifact of randomly determined
terrain, so institutions will not be designed for prosperity or justice,
but rather an artifact of randomly determined initial conditions.

Just as people can level terrain and build canals, so people can alter
the incentive landscape in order to build better institutions. But they
can only do so when they are incentivized to do so, which is not always.
As a result, some pretty wild tributaries and rapids form in some very
strange places.

I will now jump from boring game theory stuff to what might be the
closest thing to a mystical experience I've ever had.

Like all good mystical experiences, it happened in Vegas. I was standing
on top of one of their many tall buildings, looking down at the city
below, all lit up in the dark. If you've never been to Vegas, it is
*really* impressive. Skyscrapers and lights in every variety strange and
beautiful all clustered together. And I had two thoughts, crystal clear:

It is glorious that we can create something like this.

It is shameful that we *did*.

Like, by what standard is building gigantic forty-story-high indoor
replicas of Venice, Paris, Rome, Egypt, and Camelot side-by-side, filled
with albino tigers, in the middle of the most inhospitable desert in
North America, a remotely sane use of our civilization's limited
resources?

And it occurred to me that maybe there is no philosophy on Earth that
would endorse the existence of Las Vegas. Even Objectivism, which is
usually my go-to philosophy for justifying the excesses of capitalism,
at least grounds it in the belief that capitalism improves people's
lives. Henry Ford was virtuous because he allowed lots of otherwise
car-less people to obtain cars and so made them better off. What does
Vegas do? Promise a bunch of shmucks free money and not give it to them.

Las Vegas doesn't exist because of some decision to hedonically optimize
civilization, it exists because of a quirk in [dopaminergic reward
circuits](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00206/full),
plus the microstructure of an uneven regulatory environment, plus
Schelling points. A rational central planner with a god's-eye-view,
contemplating these facts, might have thought "Hm, dopaminergic reward
circuits have a quirk where certain tasks with slightly negative
risk-benefit ratios get an emotional valence associated with slightly
positive risk-benefit ratios, let's see if we can educate people to
beware of that." People within the system, *following the incentives
created by these facts*, think: "Let's build a forty-story-high indoor
replica of ancient Rome full of albino tigers in the middle of the
desert, and so become slightly richer than people who didn't!"

Just as the course of a river is latent in a terrain even before the
first rain falls on it -- so the existence of Caesar's Palace was latent
in neurobiology, economics, and regulatory regimes even before it
existed. The entrepreneur who built it was just filling in the ghostly
lines with real concrete.

So we have all this amazing technological and cognitive energy, the
brilliance of the human species, wasted on reciting the lines written by
poorly evolved cellular receptors and blind economics, like gods being
ordered around by a moron.

Some people have mystical experiences and see God. There in Las Vegas, I
*saw* Moloch.

(Moloch, whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch, whose blood is running
money!

Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch, whose skyscrapers
stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs!

Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! Invisible suburbs! Skeleton
treasuries! Blind capitals! Demonic industries! Spectral nations!)

**III.**

The Apocrypha Discordia says:

> Time flows like a river. Which is to say, downhill. We can tell this
> because everything is going downhill rapidly. It would seem prudent to
> be somewhere else when we reach the sea.

Let's take this random gag 100% literally and see where it leads us.

We just analogized the flow of incentives to the flow of a river. The
downhill trajectory is appropriate: the traps happen when you find an
opportunity to trade off a useful value for greater competitiveness.
Once everyone has it, the greater competitiveness brings you no joy --
but the value is lost forever. Therefore, each step of the Poor
Coordination Polka makes your life worse.

But not only have we not yet reached the sea, but we also seem to move
*uphill* surprisingly often. Why do things not degenerate more and more
until we are back at subsistence level? I can think of three bad reasons
-- excess resources, physical limitations, and utility maximization --
plus one good reason -- coordination.

[1. Excess resources]{.underline}. The ocean depths are a horrible place
with little light, few resources, and [various horrible
organisms](http://www.oddee.com/item_79915.aspx) dedicated to eating or
parasitizing one another. But every so often, a whale carcass falls to
the bottom of the sea. More food than the organisms that find it could
ever possibly want. There's a brief period of miraculous plenty, while
the couple of creatures that first encounter the whale feed like kings.
Eventually more animals discover the carcass, the faster-breeding
animals in the carcass multiply, the whale is gradually consumed, and
everyone sighs and goes back to living in a Malthusian death-trap.

(Slate Star Codex: Your source for macabre whale metaphors [since June
2014](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/14/living-by-the-sword/))

It's as if a group of those rats who had abandoned art and turned to
cannibalism suddenly was blown away to a new empty island with a much
higher carrying capacity, where they would once again have the breathing
room to live in peace and create artistic masterpieces.

This is an age of whalefall, an age of excess carrying capacity, an age
when we suddenly find ourselves with a thousand-mile head start on
Malthus. As Hanson puts it, [this is the dream
time](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/this-is-the-dream-time.html).

As long as resources aren't scarce enough to lock us in a war of all
against all, we can do silly non-optimal things -- like art and music
and philosophy and love -- and not be outcompeted by merciless killing
machines most of the time.

[2. Physical limitations]{.underline}. Imagine a profit-maximizing
slavemaster who decided to cut costs by not feeding his slaves or
letting them sleep. He would soon find that his slaves' productivity
dropped off drastically, and that no amount of whipping them could
restore it. Eventually after testing numerous strategies, he might find
his slaves got the most work done when they were well-fed and
well-rested and had at least a little bit of time to relax. Not because
the slaves were voluntarily withholding their labor -- we assume the
fear of punishment is enough to make them work as hard as they can --
but because the body has certain physical limitations that limit how
mean you can get away with being. Thus, the "race to the bottom" stops
somewhere short of the actual ethical bottom, when the physical limits
are run into.

John Moes, a historian of slavery, [goes further and writes
about](https://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/manumission.pdf) how the slavery
we are most familiar with -- that of the antebellum South -- is a
historical aberration and probably economically inefficient. In most
past forms of slavery -- especially those of the ancient world -- it was
common for slaves to be paid wages, treated well, and often given their
freedom.

He argues that this was the result of rational economic calculation. You
can incentivize slaves through the carrot or the stick, and the stick
isn't very good. You can't watch slaves all the time, and it's really
hard to tell whether a slave is slacking off or not (or even whether,
given a little more whipping, he might be able to work even harder). If
you want your slaves to do anything more complicated than pick cotton,
you run into some serious monitoring problems -- how do you profit from
an enslaved philosopher? Whip him really hard until he elucidates a
theory of The Good that you can sell books about?

The ancient solution to the problem -- perhaps an early inspiration to
Fnargl -- was to tell the slave to go do whatever he wanted and found
most profitable, then split the profits with him. Sometimes the slave
would work a job at your workshop and you would pay him wages based on
how well he did. Other times the slave would go off and make his way in
the world and send you some of what he earned. Still other times, you
would set a price for the slave's freedom, and the slave would go and
work and eventually come up with the mone and free himself.

Moes goes even further and says that these systems were so profitable
that there were constant smouldering attempts to try this sort of thing
in the American South. The reason they stuck with the whips-and-chains
method owed less to economic considerations and more to racist
government officials cracking down on lucrative but
not-exactly-white-supremacy-promoting attempts to free slaves and have
them go into business.

So in this case, a race to the bottom where competing plantations become
crueler and crueler to their slaves in order to maximize competitiveness
is halted by the physical limitation of cruelty not helping after a
certain point.

Or to give another example, one of the reasons we're not currently in a
Malthusian population explosion right now is that women can only have
one baby per nine months. If those weird religious sects that demand
their members have as many babies as possible could copy-paste
themselves, we would be in *really* bad shape. As it is they can only do
a small amount of damage per generation.

[3. Utility maximization]{.underline}. We've been thinking in terms of
preserving values versus winning competitions, and expecting optimizing
for the latter to destroy the former.

But many of the most important competitions / optimization processes in
modern civilization are optimizing for human values. You win at
capitalism partly by satisfying customers' values. You win at democracy
partly by satisfying voters' values.

Suppose there's a coffee plantation somewhere in Ethiopia that employs
Ethiopians to grow coffee beans that get sold to the United States.
Maybe it's locked in a life-and-death struggle with other coffee
plantations and want to throw as many values under the bus as it can to
pick up a slight advantage.

But it can't sacrifice quality of coffee produced too much, or else the
Americans won't buy it. And it can't sacrifice wages or working
conditions too much, or else the Ethiopians won't work there. And in
fact, part of its competition-optimization process is finding the best
ways to attract workers and customers that it can, as long as it doesn't
cost them too much money. So this is very promising.

But it's important to remember exactly how fragile this beneficial
equilibrium is.

Suppose the coffee plantations discover a toxic pesticide that will
increase their yield but make their customers sick. But their customers
don't know about the pesticide, and the government hasn't caught up to
regulating it yet. Now there's a tiny uncoupling between "selling to
Americans" and "satisfying Americans' values", and so of course
Americans' values get thrown under the bus.

Or suppose that there's a baby boom in Ethiopia and suddenly there are
five workers competing for each job. Now the company can afford to lower
wages and implement cruel working conditions down to whatever the
physical limits are. As soon as there's an uncoupling between "getting
Ethiopians to work here" and "satisfying Ethiopian values", it doesn't
look too good for Ethiopian values either.

Or suppose someone invents a robot that can pick coffee better and
cheaper than a human. The company fires all its laborers and throws them
onto the street to die. As soon as the utility of the Ethiopians is no
longer necessary for profit, all pressure to maintain it disappears.

Or suppose that there is some important value that is neither a value of
the employees or the customers. Maybe the coffee plantations are on the
habitat of a rare tropical bird that environmentalist groups want to
protect. Maybe they're on the ancestral burial ground of a tribe
different from the one the plantation is employing, and they want it
respected in some way. Maybe coffee growing contributes to global
warming somehow. As long as it's not a value that will prevent the
average American from buying from them or the average Ethiopian from
working for them, under the bus it goes.

I know that "capitalists sometimes do bad things" isn't exactly an
original talking point. But I do want to stress how it's not equivalent
to "capitalists are greedy". I mean, sometimes they *are* greedy. But
other times they're just in a sufficiently intense competition where
anyone who doesn't do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who
do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in
the matter.

(from my very little knowledge of Marx, he understands this very very
well and people who summarize him as "capitalists are greedy" are doing
him a disservice)

And as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less
well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, in theory
it's optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good
policymaking. But as soon as there's the slightest disconnect between
good policymaking and electability, good policymaking *has to* get
thrown under the bus.

For example, ever-increasing prison terms are unfair to inmates and
unfair to the society that has to pay for them. Politicans are unwilling
to do anything about them because they don't want to look "soft on
crime", and if a single inmate whom they helped release ever does
anything bad (and statistically one of them will have to) it will be all
over the airwaves as "Convict released by Congressman's policies kills
family of five, how can the Congressman even sleep at night let alone
claim he deserves reelection?". So even if decreasing prison populations
would be good policy -- and it is -- it will be very difficult to
implement.

*(Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless
jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment!
Moloch the stunned governments!)*

Turning "satisfying customers" and "satisfying citizens" into the
*outputs* of optimization processes was one of civilization's greatest
advances and the reason why capitalist democracies have so outperformed
other systems. But if we have bound Moloch as our servant, the bonds are
not very strong, and we sometimes find that the tasks he has done for us
move to his advantage rather than ours.

[4. Coordination]{.underline}.

The opposite of a trap is a garden.

Things are easy to solve from a god's-eye-view, so if everyone comes
together into a superorganism, that superorganism can solve problems
with ease and finesse. An intense competition between agents has turned
into a garden, with a single gardener dictating where everything should
go and removing elements that do not conform to the pattern.

As I pointed out in the Non-Libertarian FAQ, government can easily solve
the pollution problem with fish farms. The best known solution to the
Prisoners' Dilemma is for the mob boss (playing the role of a governor)
to threaten to shoot any prisoner who defects. The solution to companies
polluting and harming workers is government regulations against such.
Governments solve arm races *within* a country by maintaining a monopoly
on the use of force, and it's easy to see that if a truly effective
world government ever arose, international military buildups would end
pretty quickly.

The two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence -- or
more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things
besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able
to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps.

For example, since students are competing against each other (directly
if classes are graded on a curve, but always indirectly for college
admissions, jobs, et cetera) there is intense pressure for individual
students to cheat. The teacher and school play the role of a government
by having rules (for example, against cheating) and the ability to
punish students who break them.

But the emergent social structure of the students themselves is also a
sort of government. If students shun and distrust cheaters, then there
are rules (don't cheat) and an enforcement mechanism (or else we will
shun you).

Social codes, gentlemens' agreements, industrial guilds, criminal
organizations, traditions, friendships, schools, corporations, and
religions are all coordinating institutions that keep us out of traps by
changing our incentives.

But these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized
themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are
competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera -- there's no reason
they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and
indeed they aren't. Governments can in theory keep corporations,
citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are
many traps that governments themselves can fall into.

The United States tries to solve the problem by having multiple levels
of government, unbreakable constutitional laws, checks and balances
between different branches, and a couple of other hacks.

Saudi Arabia uses a different tactic. They just put one guy in charge of
everything.

This is the much-maligned -- I think unfairly -- argument in favor of
monarchy. A monarch is an unincentivized incentivizer. He *actually* has
the god's-eye-view and is outside of and above every system. He has
permanently won all competitions and is not competing for anything, and
therefore he is perfectly free of Moloch and of the incentives that
would otherwise channel his incentives into predetermined paths. Aside
from a few very theoretical proposals like my [Shining
Garden](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/06/raikoth-laws-language-and-society/),
monarchy is the *only* system that does this.

But then instead of following a random incentive structure, we're
following the whim of one guy. Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino is a
crazy waste of resources, but the actual Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus
Germanicus wasn't exactly the perfect benevolent rational central
planner either.

The libertarian-authoritarian axis on the Political Compass is a
tradeoff between discoordination and tyranny. You can have everything
perfectly coordinated by someone with a god's-eye-view -- but then you
risk Stalin. And you can be totally free of all central authority -- but
then you're stuck in every stupid multipolar trap Moloch can devise.

The libertarians make a convincing argument for the one side, and the
monarchists for the other, but I expect that [like most
tradeoffs](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/01/searching-for-one-sided-tradeoffs/)
we just have to hold our noses and admit it's a really hard problem.

**IV.**

Let's go back to that Apocrypha Discordia quote:

> Time flows like a river. Which is to say, downhill. We can tell this
> because everything is going downhill rapidly. It would seem prudent to
> be somewhere else when we reach the sea.

What would it mean, in this situation, to reach the sea?

Multipolar traps -- races to the bottom -- threaten to destroy all human
values. They are currently restrained by physical limitations, excess
resources, utility maximization, and coordination.

The dimension along which this metaphorical river flows must be time,
and the most important change in human civilization over time is the
change in technology. So the relevant question is how technological
changes will affect our tendency to fall into multipolar traps.

I described traps as when:

> ...in some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to
> throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it
> prosper. Those who don't take it die out. Eventually, everyone's
> relative status is about the same as before, but everyone's absolute
> status is worse than before. The process continues until all other
> values that can be traded off have been -- in other words, until human
> ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.

That "the opportunity arises" phrase is looking pretty sinister.
Technology is all about creating new opportunities.

Develop a new robot, and suddenly coffee plantations have "the
opportunity" to automate their harvest and fire all the Ethiopian
workers. Develop nuclear weapons, and suddenly countries are stuck in an
arms race to have enough of them. Polluting the atmosphere to build
products quicker wasn't a problem before they invented the steam engine.

The limit of multipolar traps as technology approaches infinity is "very
bad".

Multipolar traps are currently restrained by physical limitations,
excess resources, utility maximization, and coordination.

[Physical limitations]{.underline} are most obviously conquered by
increasing technology. The slavemaster's old conundrum -- that slaves
need to eat and sleep -- succumbs to Soylent and modafinil. The problem
of slaves running away succumbs to GPS. The problem of slaves being too
stressed to do good work succumbs to Valium. None of these things are
very good for the slaves.

(or just invent a robot that doesn't need food or sleep at all. What
happens to the slaves after that is better left unsaid)

The other example of physical limits was one baby per nine months, and
this was understating the case -- it's really "one baby per nine months
plus willingness to support and take care of a basically helpless and
extremely demanding human being for eighteen years". This puts a damper
on the enthusiasm of even the most zealous religious sect's "go forth
and multiply" dictum.

But as Bostrom puts it in
[*Superintelligence*](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=slatestarcode-20&linkId=b90156dae75d7113131ab6d75fe00c0c):

As always when dealing with high-level transhumanists, "all available
hardware" should be taken to include "the atoms that used to be part of
your body".

The idea of biological *or* cultural evolution causing a mass population
explosion is a philosophical toy at best. The idea of technology making
it possible is both plausible and terrifying. Now we see that "physical
limits" segues very naturally into "excess resources" -- the ability to
create new agents very quickly means that unless everyone can coordinate
to ban doing this, the people who do will outcompete the people who
don't until they have reached carrying capacity and everyone is stuck at
subsistence level.

[Excess resources]{.underline}, which until now have been a gift of
technological progress, therefore switch and become a casualty of it at
a sufficiently high tech level.

[Utility maximization]{.underline}, always on shaky ground, also faces
new threats. In the face of continuing debate about this point, I
*continue* to think it obvious that robots will push humans out of work
or at least drive down wages (which, in the existence of a minimum wage,
pushes humans out of work).

Once a robot can do everything an IQ 80 human can do, only better and
cheaper, there will be no reason to employ IQ 80 humans. Once a robot
can do everything an IQ 120 human can do, only better and cheaper, there
will be no reason to employ IQ 120 humans. Once a robot can do
everything an IQ 180 human can do, only better and cheaper, there will
be no reason to employ humans at all, in the unlikely scenario that
there are any left by that point.

In the earlier stages of the process, capitalism becomes more and more
uncoupled from its previous job as an optimizer for human values. Now
most humans are totally locked out of the group whose values capitalism
optimizes for. They have no value to contribute as workers -- and since
in the absence of a spectacular social safety net it's unclear how they
would have much money -- they have no value as customers either.
Capitalism has passed them by. As the segment of humans who can be
outcompeted by robots increases, capitalism passes by more and more
people until eventually it locks out the human race entirely, once again
in the vanishingly unlikely scenario that we are still around.

(there are some scenarios in which a few capitalists who own the robots
may benefit here, but in either case the vast majority are out of luck)

Democracy is less obviously vulnerable, but it might be worth going back
to Bostrom's paragraph about the Quiverfull movement. These are some
really religious Christians who think that God wants them to have as
many kids as possible, and who can end up with families of ten or more.
Their [articles explictly
calculate](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/01/quiverfull-outbreeding-the-world.html)
that if they start at two percent of the population, but have on average
eight children per generation when everyone else on average only has
two, within three generations they'll make up half the population.

It's a clever strategy, but I can think of one thing that will save us:
judging by how many ex-Quiverfull blogs I found when searching for those
statistics, their retention rates even within a single generation are
pretty grim. Their article admits that 80% of very religious children
leave the church as adults (although of course they expect their own
movement to do better). And this is not a symmetrical process -- 80% of
children who grow up in atheist families aren't becoming Quiverfull.

It looks a lot like even though they are outbreeding us, we are
outmeme-ing them, and that gives us a decisive advantage.

But we should also be kind of scared of this process. Memes optimize for
making people want to accept them and pass them on -- so like capitalism
and democracy, they're optimizing for a *proxy* of making us happy, but
that proxy can easily get uncoupled from the original goal.

Chain letters, urban legends, propaganda, and viral marketing are all
examples of memes that don't satisfy our explicit values (true and
useful) but are sufficiently memetically virulent that they spread
anyway.

I hope it's not too controversial here to say the same thing is true of
religion. Religions, at their heart, are the most basic form of memetic
replicator -- "Believe this statement and repeat it to everyone you hear
or else you will be eternally tortured".

The creationism "debate" and global warming "debate" and a host of
similar "debates" in today's society suggest that memes that can
propagate independent of their truth value has a pretty strong influence
on the political process. Maybe these memes propagate because they
appeal to people's prejudices, maybe because they're simple, maybe
because they effectively mark an in-group and an out-group, or maybe for
all sorts of different reasons.

The point is -- imagine a country full of bioweapon labs, where people
toil day and night to invent new infectious agents. The existence of
these labs, and their right to throw whatever they develop in the water
supply is protected by law. And the country is also linked by the
world's most perfect mass transit system that every single person uses
every day, so that any new pathogen can spread to the entire country
instantaneously. You'd expect things to start going bad for that city
pretty quickly.

Well, we have about a zillion think tanks researching new and better
forms of propaganda. And we have constitutionally protected freedom of
speech. And we have the Internet. So we're kind of screwed.

*(Moloch whose name is the Mind!)*

There are a few people working on [raising the sanity
waterline](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/),
but not as many people as are working on new and exciting ways of
confusing and converting people, cataloging and exploiting every single
bias and heuristic and dirty rhetorical trick

So as technology (which I take to include knowledge of psychology,
sociology, public relations, etc) tends to infinity, the power of
truthiness relative to truth increases, and things don't look great for
real grassroots democracy. The worst-case scenario is that the ruling
party learns to produce infinite charisma on demand. If that doesn't
sound so bad to you, remember what Hitler was able to do with an
famously high level of charisma that was still less-than-infinite.

(alternate phrasing for Chomskyites: technology increases the efficiency
of manufacturing consent in the same way it increases the efficiency of
manufacturing everything else)

[Coordination]{.underline} is what's left. And technology has the
potential to seriously *improve* coordination efforts. People can use
the Internet to get in touch with one another, launch political
movements, and [fracture off into
subcommunities](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/).

But coordination only works when you have 51% or more of the force on
the side of the people doing the coordinating, and when you haven't come
up with some brilliant trick to make coordination impossible.

The second one first. In the links post before last, I wrote:

> The latest development in the brave new post-Bitcoin world is
> [crypto-equity](http://panampost.com/belen-marty/2014/07/04/move-over-kickstarter-swarm-crypto-equity-is-the-next-frontier/).
> At this point I've gone from wanting to praise these inventors as bold
> libertarian heroes to wanting to drag them in front of a blackboard
> and making them write a hundred times "I WILL NOT CALL UP THAT WHICH I

A couple people asked me what I meant, and I didn't have the background
then to explain. Well, this post is the background. People are using the
*contingent* stupidity of our current government to replace lots of
human interaction with mechanisms that cannot be coordinated even in
principle. I totally understand why all these things are good right now
when most of what our government does is stupid and unnecessary. But
there is going to come a time when -- after one too many bioweapon or
nanotech or nuclear incidents -- we, as a civilization, are going to
wish we hadn't established untraceable and unstoppable ways of selling
products.

And if we ever get real live superintelligence, pretty much by
definition it is going to have \>51% of the power and all attempts at
"coordination" with it will be useless.

So I agree with Robin Hanson: [This is the dream
time](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/this-is-the-dream-time.html).
This is a rare confluence of circumstances where the we are unusually
safe from multipolar traps, and as such weird things like art and
science and philosophy and love can flourish.

As technological advance increases, the rare confluence will come to an
end. New opportunities to throw values under the bus for increased
competitiveness will arise. New ways of copying agents to increase the
population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus'
unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors,
will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on
human values. And our coordination power will not be nearly up to the
task, assuming something much more powerful than all of us combined
doesn't show up and crush our combined efforts with a wave of its paw.

Absent an extraordinary effort to divert it, the river reaches the sea
in one of two places.

It can end in Eliezer Yudkowsky's nightmare of a superintelligence
optimizing for some random thing (classically [paper
clips](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer)) because we
weren't smart enough to channel its optimization efforts the right way.
This is the ultimate trap, the trap that catches the universe.
Everything except the one thing being maximized is destroyed utterly in
pursuit of the single goal, including all the silly human values.

Or it can end in Robin Hanson's nightmare (he doesn't call it a
nightmare, but [I think he's
wrong](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/06/poor-folks-do-smile-for-now/))
of a competition between emulated humans that can copy themselves and
edit their own source code as desired. Their total self-control can wipe
out even the *desire* for human values in their all-consuming contest.
What happens to art, philosophy, science, and love in such a world? Zack
Davis puts it with characteristic genius:

But even after we have thrown away science, art, love, and philosophy,
there's still one thing left to lose, one final sacrifice Moloch might
demand of us. Bostrom again:

The last value we have to sacrifice is being anything at all, having the
lights on inside. With sufficient technology we will be "able" to give
up even the final spark.

*(Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!*)

Everything the human race has worked for -- all of our technology, all
of our civilization, all the hopes we invested in our future -- might be
accidentally handed over to some kind of unfathomable blind idiot alien
god that discards all of them, and consciousness itself, in order to
participate in some weird fundamental-level mass-energy economy that
leads to it disassembling Earth and everything on it for its component
atoms.

*(Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!)*

Bostrom realizes that some people fetishize intelligence, that they are
rooting for that blind alien god as some sort of higher form of life
that ought to crush us for its own "higher good" the way we crush ants.
He argues (Superintelligence, p. 219):

Remember: Moloch can't agree even to this 99.99999% victory. Rats racing
to populate an island don't leave a little aside as a preserve where the
few rats who live there can live happy lives producing artwork. Cancer
cells don't agree to leave the lungs alone because they realize it's
important for the body to get oxygen. Competition and optimization are
blind idiotic processes and they fully intend to deny us even one lousy
galaxy.

We will break our back lifting Moloch to Heaven, but unless something
changes it will be his victory and not ours.

**V.**

"Gnon" is [Nick Land's](http://www.xenosystems.net/the-cult-of-gnon/)
shorthand for "Nature And Nature's God", except the A is changed to an O
and the whole thing is reversed, because Nick Land react to
comprehensibility the same way as vampires to sunlight.

Land argues that humans should be more Gnon-conformist (pun
Gnon-intentional). He says we do all these stupid things like divert
useful resources to feed those who could never survive on their own, or
supporting the poor in ways that encourage dysgenic reproduction, or
allowing cultural degeneration to undermine the state. This means our
society is denying natural law, basically listening to Nature say things
like "this cause has this effect" and putting our fingers in our ears
and saying "NO IT DOESN'T". Civilizations that do this too much tend to
decline and fall, which is Gnon's fair and dispassionately-applied
punishment for violating His laws.

He identifies Gnon with Kipling's Gods of the Copybook Headings.

These are of course the proverbs from [Kipling's eponymous
poem](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_copybook.htm) -- maxims like
"If you don't work, you die" and "The wages of sin is Death". If you
have somehow not yet read it, I predict you will find it delightful
regardless of what you think of its politics.

I notice that it takes only a slight irregularity in the abbreviation of
"headings" -- far less irregularity than it takes to turn "Nature and
Nature's God" into "Gnon" -- for the proper acronym of "Gods of the
Copybook Headings" to be "GotCHa".

I find this appropriate.

"If you don't work, you die." Gotcha! If you *do* work, you *also* die!
Everyone dies, unpredictably, at a time not of their own choosing, and
all the virtue in the world does not save you.

"The wages of sin is Death." Gotcha! The wages of everything is Death!
This is a Communist universe, the amount you work makes no difference to
your eventual reward. From each according to his ability, to each Death.

"Stick to the Devil you know." Gotcha! The Devil you know is Satan! And
if he gets his hand on your soul you either die the true death, or get
eternally tortured forever, or somehow both at once.

Since we're starting to get into Lovecraftian monsters, let me bring up
one of Lovecraft's less known short stories, [The Other
Gods](http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/theothergods.htm).

It's only a couple of pages, but if you absolutely refuse to read it --
the gods of Earth are relatively young as far as deities go. A very
strong priest or magician can occasionally outsmart and overpower them
-- so Barzai the Wise decides to climb their sacred mountain and join in
their festivals, whether they want him to or not.

But the beyond the seemingly tractable gods of Earth lie the Outer Gods,
the terrible omnipotent beings of incarnate cosmic chaos. As soon as
Barzai joins in the festival, the Outer Gods show up and pull him
screaming into the abyss.

As stories go, it lacks things like plot or characterization or setting
or point. But for some reason it stuck with me.

And identifying the Gods Of The Copybook Headings with Nature seems to
me the same magnitude of mistake as identifying the gods of Earth with
the Outer Gods. And likely to end about the same way: Gotcha!

You break your back lifting Moloch to Heaven, and then Moloch turns on
you and gobbles you up.

More Lovecraft: the Internet popularization of the Cthulhu Cult claims
that if you help free Cthulhu from his watery grave, he will reward you
by [eating you
first](http://foo.ca/wp/chick-tract-satire/who-will-be-eaten-first/),
thus sparing you the horror of seeing everyone else eaten. This is a
misrepresentation of the original text. In the original, his cultists
receive no reward for freeing him from his watery prison, not even the
reward of being killed in a slightly less painful manner.

On the margin, compliance with the Gods of the Copybook Headings, Gnon,
Cthulhu, whatever, may buy you slightly more time than the next guy. But
then again, it might not. And in the long run, we're all dead and our
civilization has been destroyed by unspeakable alien monsters.

At some point, somebody has to say "You know, maybe freeing Cthulhu from
his watery prison is a *bad idea*. Maybe we should *not do that*."

That person will not be Nick Land. He is [totally one hundred percent in
favor](http://www.xenosystems.net/pythia-unbound/) of freeing Cthulhu
from his watery prison and extremely annoyed that it is not happening
fast enough. I have *such mixed feelings* about Nick Land. On the grail
quest for the True Futurology, he has gone 99.9% of the path and then
missed the *very* last turn, the one marked [ORTHOGONALITY
THESIS](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis).

But the thing about grail quests is -- if you make a wrong turn two
blocks away from your house, you end up at the corner store feeling
mildly embarrassed. If you do *almost* everything right and then miss
the very last turn, you end up being eaten by the legendary Black Beast
of Aaargh whose ichorous stomach acid erodes your very soul into
gibbering fragments.

As far as I can tell from reading his blog, Nick Land is the guy in that
terrifying border region where he is smart enough to figure out several
important arcane principles about summoning demon gods, but not quite
smart enough to figure out the most important such principle, which is
NEVER DO THAT.

**VI.**

Warg Franklin analyzes the same situation and does a little better. He
names "the Four Horsemen of Gnon" -- capitalism, war, evolution, and
memetics -- the same processes I talked about above.

This seems to me the strongest argument for authoritarianism. Multipolar
traps are likely to destroy us, so we should shift the
tyranny-multipolarity tradeoff towards a rationally-planned garden,
which requires centralized monarchical authority and strongly-binding
traditions.

But a brief digression into social evolution. Societies, like animals,
evolve. The ones that survive spawn memetic descendants -- for example,
the success of Britan allowed it to spin off Canada, Australia, the US,
et cetera. Thus, we expect societies that exist to be somewhat optimized
for stability and prosperity. I think this is one of the strongest
conservative arguments. Just as a random change to a letter in the human
genome will probably be deleterious rather than beneficial since humans
are a complicated fine-tuned system whose genome has been pre-optimized
for survival -- so most changes to our cultural DNA will disrupt some
institution that evolved to help Anglo-American (or whatever) society
outcompete its real and hypothetical rivals.

The liberal counterargument to that is that evolution is [a blind idiot
alien god](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/) that optimizes for
stupid things and has no concern with human value. Thus, the fact that
some species of wasps paralyze caterpillars, lay their eggs inside of
it, and have its young devour the still-living paralyzed caterpillar
from the inside doesn't set off evolution's moral sensor, because
evolution doesn't *have* a moral sensor because evolution doesn't care.

Suppose that in fact patriarchy is adaptive to societies because it
allows women to spend all their time bearing children who can then
engage in productive economic activity and fight wars. The social
evolutionary processes that cause societies to adopt patriarchy *still*
have exactly as little concern for its moral effects on women as the
biological evolutionary processes that cause wasps to lay their eggs in
caterpillars.

Evolution doesn't care. But we do care. There's a tradeoff between
Gnon-compliance -- saying "Okay, the strongest possible society is a
patriarchal one, we should implement patriarchy" and our human values --
like women who want to do something other than bear children.

Too far to one side of the tradeoff, and we have unstable impoverished
societies that die out for going against natural law. Too far to the
other side, and we have lean mean fighting machines that are murderous
and miserable. Think your local anarchist commune versus Sparta.

I maybe agree with Warg here more than I have ever agreed with anyone
else about anything. He says something really important and he says it
beautifully and there are so many words of praise I want to say for this
post and for the thought processes behind it.

But what I am actually going to say is...

Gotcha! You die anyway!

Suppose you make your walled garden. You keep out all of the dangerous
memes, you subordinate capitalism to human interests, you ban stupid
bioweapons research, you *definitely* don't research nanotechnology or
strong AI.

Everyone outside *doesn't* do those things. And so the only question is
whether you'll be destroyed by foreign diseases, foreign memes, foreign
armies, foreign economic competition, or foreign existential
catastrophes.

As foreigners compete with you -- and there's no wall high enough to
block all competition -- you have a couple of choices. You can get
outcompeted and destroyed. You can join in the race to the bottom. Or
you can invest more and more civilizational resources into building your
wall -- whatever that is in a non-metaphorical way -- and protecting
yourself.

I can imagine ways that a "rational theocracy" and "conservative
patriarchy" might not be terrible to live under, given exactly the right
conditions. But you don't get to choose exactly the right conditions.
You get to choose the extremely constrained set of conditions that
"capture Gnon". As outside civilizations compete against you, your
conditions will become more and more constrained.

Warg talks about trying to avoid "a future of meaningless gleaming
techno-progress burning the cosmos". Do you really think your walled
garden will be able to ride this out?

Hint: is it part of the cosmos?

Yeah, you're kind of screwed.

I want to critique Warg. But I want to critique him in the exact
opposite direction as the last critique he received. In fact, the last
critique he received is so bad that I want to discuss it at length so we
can get the correct critique entirely by taking its exact mirror image.

So here is Hurlock's [On Capturing Gnon And Naive
Rationalism](http://hurlock-151.tumblr.com/post/91738304666/on-capturing-gnon-and-naive-rationalism).

Hurlock spouts only the most craven Gnon-conformity. A few excerpts:

I accuse Hurlock of being stuck behind the veil. When the veil is
lifted, Gnon-aka-the-GotCHa-aka-the-Gods-of-Earth turn out to be
Moloch-aka-the-Outer-Gods. Submitting to them doesn't make you "free",
there's no spontaneous order, any gifts they have given you are an
unlikely and contingent output of a blind idiot process whose next
iteration will just as happily destroy you.

Submit to Gnon? Gotcha! As the Antarans put it, "you may not surrender,
you can not win, your only option is to die."

**VII.**

So let me confess guilt to one of Hurlock's accusations: I am a
transhumanist and I really do want to rule the universe.

Not personally -- I mean, I wouldn't object if someone personally
offered me the job, but I don't expect anyone will. I would like humans,
or something that respects humans, or at least gets along with humans --
to have the job.

But the current rulers of the universe -- call them what you want,
Moloch, Gnon, whatever -- want us dead, and with us everything we value.
Art, science, love, philosophy, consciousness itself, the entire bundle.
And since I'm not down with that plan, I think defeating them and taking
their place is a pretty high priority.

The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all
human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to
install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human
values.

And the whole point of Bostrom's
[*Superintelligence*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0199678111&linkCode=as2&tag=slastacod-20&linkId=MLLWPLYEFTPAGE4X)
is that this is within our reach. Once humans can design machines that
are smarter than we are, by definition they'll be able to design
machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines
smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will
smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a
comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing
entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But
the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with
one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so
that it can suppress any competition -- including competition for its
title of most powerful entity -- permanently. In the very near future,
we are going to lift *something* to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it
might be something on our side. If it's on our side, it can *kill Moloch
dead*.

And if that entity shares human values, it can allow human values to
flourish unconstrained by natural law.

I realize that sounds like hubris -- it certainly did to Hurlock -- but
I think it's the opposite of hubris, or at least a hubris-minimizing
position.

To expect God to care about you or your personal values or the values of
your civilization, that's hubris.

To expect God to bargain with you, to allow you to survive and prosper
as long as you submit to Him, that's hubris.

To expect to wall off a garden where God can't get to you and hurt you,
that's hubris.

To expect to be able to remove God from the picture entirely...well, at
least it's an actionable strategy.

I am a transhumanist because I do not have enough hubris not to try to
kill God.

**VIII.**

The Universe is a dark and foreboding place, suspended between alien
deities. Cthulhu, Gnon, Moloch, call them what you will.

Somewhere in this darkness is another god. He has also had many names.
In the [*Kushiel*
books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765347539/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0765347539&linkCode=as2&tag=slastacod-20&linkId=BZSMMGHFLI7TQTEK)![](https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=slastacod-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0765347539){decoding="async"
width="1" height="1" border="0"
style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"}, his name was
Elua. He is the god of flowers and free love and all soft and fragile
things. Of art and science and philosophy and love. Of [niceness,
community, and
civilization](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/).
He is a god of humans.

The other gods sit on their dark thrones and think "Ha ha, a god who
doesn't even control any hell-monsters or command his worshippers to
become killing machines. What a weakling! This is going to be so easy!"

But somehow Elua is still here. No one knows exactly how. And the gods
who oppose Him tend to find Themselves meeting with a *surprising*
number of unfortunate accidents.

There are many gods, but this one is ours.

Bertrand Russell said: "One should respect public opinion insofar as is
necessary to avoid starvation and keep out of prison, but anything that
goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny."

So be it with Gnon. Our job is to placate him insofar as is necessary to
avoid starvation and invasion. And that only for a short time, until we
come into our full power.

*"It is only a [childish thing](http://hpmor.com/chapter/45), that the
human species has not yet outgrown. And someday, we'll get over it."*

Other gods get placated until we're strong enough to take them on. Elua
gets worshipped.

*I think this is an [excellent]{.underline} battle cry*

And at some point, matters will come to a head.

The question everyone has after reading Ginsberg is: what is Moloch?

My answer is: Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is
the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss
your babies in exchange for victory in war.

He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most
into the flames, and I can grant you power.

As long as the offer's open, it will be irresistible. So we need to
close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our
side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.

Ginsberg's poem famously begins "I saw the best minds of my generation
destroyed by madness". I am luckier than Ginsberg. I got to see the best
minds of my generation identify a problem and *get to work*.

(

Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the
American river!

Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of
sensitive bullshit!

Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the
flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years' animal screams and
suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!

Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the
holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude!
waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!)

    This is strikingly beautiful -- one of the best I've read from you.

    One somewhat rambling thought I took away from this post, oddly
    enough, is that -- in the face of a potential superintelligence --
    the status quo is not the only alternative to trying to build a
    Friendly AI.

    Democracy, monarchism, and a designed-to-be-Friendly AI can be
    compared according to the risk aversion one should adopt in the face
    of Moloch. A US-style democracy produces predictably mediocre
    results, year after year (we obviously notice the swings from one
    election cycle to another, but that's probably scope insensitivity
    compared to all of the unstable political systems in history). A
    monarchy promises the ability to impose mutually beneficial
    coordination from above -- but can produce highly unpredictable
    results, leading to tyranny, civil wars, revolutions, etc. A
    designed-to-be-Friendly AI promises the possibility of optimization
    of all of our values, but the orthogonality thesis shows the
    fragility of any attempt to make one truly friendly.

    Thus, the question of whether to be a democrat or a monarchist, a
    luddite or a transhumanist seems to boil down mostly to one's
    approach to risk and, slightly, to how dangerous one thinks Moloch
    is (in one scenario, Moloch is a constant slide into despair,
    suffering, and things that could be so close but are so far away. In
    the other scenario, Moloch is existential risk and \*annihilation\*)

    The only response to the threat of annihilation need not be one that
    has the power to annihilate as well. I imagine (though I think a
    substantial portion of the readership would disagree) that any
    political system with even vague autocratic tendencies could be
    convinced to regulate the possibility of a super-human AI out of
    existence.

    So, a possibility: that monarchism/global autocracy is a less risky
    strategy for confronting a superintelligence than attempting to
    build a Friendly AI. The relevant questions for this tradeoff:\
    1. How likely is a superintelligence will be built by Moloch, if
    nothing is done -- one that would cause not just despair but
    annihilation? \[my estimation: highly\]\
    2. How likely is it that a designed-to-be-Friendly AI could be built
    with confidence before Moloch finishes its superintelligence? \[my
    estimation: low/medium\]\
    3. How likely is it that a designed-to-be-Friendly AI will not
    create a similar annhilation to that of Moloch's superintelligence?
    \[my estimation: low\]\
    4. How likely is it that a global monarchy/autocracy could be
    effectively implemented before Moloch finishes its
    superintelligence? \[my estimation: medium\]\
    5. How likely is it that a global monarchy/autocracy will not will
    not create a similar annhilation to that of Moloch's
    superintelligence? \[my estimation: high\]

    EDIT: the estimations are mostly here for fun -- I think the
    questions are the important part. I make no claim to being
    well-calibrated.

        Ah, but super-human AI is not the only way Moloch can bring our
        demise. How many such dangers can your global monarch identify
        in time? EMs, nanotechnology, memetic contamination, and all the
        other unknown ways we're running to the bottom...

        And even if you assume perfect leadership from that government,
        you've still only built a walled garden. If there exists any
        other intelligence in the universe, and they build they AI
        first, maybe it's not moloch that eats you, but you're eaten
        anyway (after a reasonable period of stagnation)

            I didn't actually talk to Scott about this so whatever tiny
            amounts of money that might actually come from this go to
            whatever he says.

            Also if someone else wants to do this in a better way I
            won't be offended. Just it took very little effort and
            seemed like it would make people happy.

            (Oh also if people can suggest the actual font that would be
            nice. I was not sure.)

    Regarding the "people with bad memes will outbreed us" point: have
    you considered general reductions in fertility -- methods such as
    destigmatizing and encouraging abortion, making birth control more
    available, paying people to get sterilized, and perhaps parental
    licensing?

        It seems to me that except in the last case (and maybe even
        then) all those methods are self defeating. They will simply
        cause selection in favour of those that ignore the incentives. I
        come from a religious Family of 11 and very much doubt any
        incentive could have swayed my parents.

        Edit: Indeed I think that it would likely have a negative result
        from your point of view. People such as my parents (or myself)
        would never accept being sterilized at any incentive but plenty
        of people who would likely only have had a couple of kids anyway
        might.

            That still seems like an improvement compared to the status
            quo. If currently there are people who are having children
            and shouldn't, some of them not having children is better
            than all of them having children.

                In the short run maybe. It also, however, hastens the
                slide to a state of affairs where the world population
                is composed overwhelmingly from descendants of people
                who have large families thus heavily selecting for the
                genes (or hereditary memes) that want large families. It
                seems that any progress you make in the short run with
                this technique will be undone in the long run.

                You're selecting for 'people who want large families
                \*no matter what\*' over 'people who might want large
                families if they're a reasonable thing to have'. That

                I think what you'd do with paying for sterilization is
                to lop off both ends of the IQ bell curve. Those who
                think a malthusian scenario is ultimately unavoidable
                may well take the little extra incentive. But also those
                with poor impulse control or inability to connect cause
                and effect.

                Except that the sort of people who won't try to outbreed
                us are the kind of people we're trying to select
                \*for\*, remember?

                Because we don't \*want\* to be outbred, and we would
                rather \*not\* starve in a Malthusian gutter.

                Y'know, if that's an option.

                I'm thinking more in terms of people who have poor

                when they can't afford to have them. Hence my support

            There's a worse problem with eugenics of any sort, if you
            think that *impartiality* is a virtue or necessary for
            justice at all.

            Deciding for others which genes deserve to survive to the
            next generation, is probably the question you are *least*
            objective about. You're a stinking bag of genes yourself!
            How can you pretend to set yourself as judge over genes your
            own genes compete with?

            That's just a power grab, pure and simple. If someone whose
            genes you've deemed unworthy decides to preemptively murder
            you, you have forfeited the right to morally object to that
            at all. They're just doing what's best for their genes, and
            you can't pretend to do anything more yourself.

                It's not about genes, it's about what's best for
                children. Being born in poverty, being born to abusive
                parents, etc, is bad for them, and parental licensing
                would ameliorate that. I suppose in theory parental
                licensing could be designed in such a way as to prevent
                genetic birth defects, but that's not why I support it.
                I certainly don't support it for the purpose of
                suppressing arbitrary genes.

                I think you're conflating what hypothetical eugenicists
                want for humanity with what genes themselves, er,
                "want." The eugenicist isn't competing with other's
                genes, because the eugenicist doesn't set out to ensure
                that his own genes reach higher frequencies. Eugenics
                isn't social Darwinism. In fact, it's its opposite.

                And, because I skimmed before, I just noticed this:

                "Instead of the destructive free reign of evolution and
                the sexual market, we would be better off with
                deliberate and conservative patriarchy and eugenics
                driven by the judgement of man within the constraints
                set by Gnon."

                I'm inclined to think that nrx eugenics looks vastly
                different from non-nrx version, but maybe not?

        What's it to you? Best case, you'd have thrown some (perhaps
        already sickly) babies to Moloch in order to temporarily save
        some other babies.

        To get non-figurative, you'll have sacrificed some values (like
        "government shouldn't seize control over reproduction") in order
        to make tomorrow's children slightly more likely to be bland
        utilitarian atheist/transhumanists like yourselves.

        But you'll personally be dead anyway when that happens, and your
        values -- such as they are -- will be a little more compromised,
        a little closer to "dying". Not that I understand why that would
        matter to you at a point in time where you'll be dead.

            I care about humanity surviving and people being happy
            beyond my lifetime. A quasi-Malthusian (outbred by people
            with bad social norms) or traditional Malthusian scenario is
            an obstacle to that end, so if something makes it less
            likely, that's good. And the sooner we start, the sooner
            we'll see the benefits.

                Well, part of the point is, you're not really changing
                anything fundamental, are you? You're just taking a
                little step down the path. At least in my eyes,
                "government should seize control over procreation" *is*
                a bad social norm. You're already throwing some babies
                to Moloch in order to save the rest.

                But why should it stop there? Why are you so sure that
                your kids won't go further, sacrifice a few more values?
                As far as I can see you're still very much on the path
                to some sort of hell (quasi-Malthusian, Disneyland
                without kids, whatever).

                > I care about humanity surviving and people being happy
                > beyond my lifetime.

                Well, that is evident. But if you could surgically
                remove this care from yourself and thereby become a
                happier person, why shouldn't you? After all, it seems
                the people you imagine being happy beyond your lifetime
                will be happy because they've sacrificed some moral
                values, like "do not be a totalitarian eugenicist". Why
                not beat them to it, butcher a few sacred cows yourself,
                and become a laughing lion hedonist with no care in the
                world?

                I think the problem with your perspectives (speaking to
                all transhumanist-utilitarian types here) is that you
                haven't decided who you are, *what* you want to live on.
                You don't know what your soul is, thus you can't spot it
                when you're trading it away for the world (as per the
                Matthew quote).

                "At least in my eyes, ;government should seize control
                over procreation' is a bad social norm."

                It's undesirable on its own, but its benefits may
                outweigh its drawbacks, just like pushing a guy in front
                of a trolley is bad on its own, but it's worth it if it
                saves five people. Here, we compare the cost of some
                burden on parents who want to have children to the
                benefits of fewer abused children, fewer children born
                in poverty, etc, and I think the side of "happier
                children" wins. I'm not sacrificing any values -- I
                acknowledge and would continue to acknowledge that
                parental licensing has some drawbacks, but the current
                tradeoff of low barriers to entry to being a parent and
                people who shouldn't have children having children is
                suboptimal. My values aren't changing, quite the
                opposite, I'm advocating for a world more in line with
                my current values.

                Harald, I know damn well what my soul is. I have stared

                acknowledge it.

                Now, why on Earth should I let slip to you what's in

        Remember that 80% of fundamentalist children leave the church.
        Many ex-Quiverfull kids have only one or two children. I'm not
        sure what's up with the Haredim, but they may feel themselves as
        under the same kind of social stress as the Palestinians, who
        have a similar high birthrate. This at least argues that "having
        lots of babies" is more complicated than simple heritability,
        that there may be environmental factors we can tune rather than
        overt eugenics.\
        If there were a chemical -- odorless, tasteless, hypoallergenic
        -- whose only effect would be to make people want to have no
        more than one child, would you dump that chemical into the water
        supply?\
        I would.

            You're selecting for people with resistance to that
            chemical, which I suppose is at least better than people
            harboring virulent totalizing memes that dictate bearing and
            weaponizing as many children as possible.

                Chemical resistance? Hah! Bacteria breed about a million
                times faster than us and they still have trouble
                evolving resistance to our chemical weapons.

                Antibiotics are relatively straightforward things: bind
                to *these* sites, disrupt *this* metabolic pathway, and
                the bacterium dies. Antibiotic resistance does happen,
                but it needs to hit a small target, and outside of a
                Petri dish it needs to do it fast enough that the
                resistant strains can establish a defensible population
                before the host's immune response stomps all over it.

                A chemical that was able to enforce this kind of change
                in reproductive patterns would presumably be doing
                something a lot more complicated: just making people
                less likely to reproduce *on average* wouldn't be good
                enough, since it's *differential* reproduction that we
                care about. That means that whatever it's doing, it'd be
                a lot easier for random mutation to break.

                I suppose that's reasonable. Such a chemical is unlikely
                to be found, and conditional on such a thing being
                discovered it is unlikely to work perfectly. Similarly,
                unlike in antibiotics we are unlikely to find multiple
                such chemicals with different mechanisms.

                Although the cached thought behind that comment is not
                quite applicable in that context, I still think it is
                relevant in this discussion. I think the conflict
                between humans and bacteria shows that evolution *can*
                be defeated, even if it isn't clear we'll win that
                particular war. That humans breed much more slowly means
                that human evolution should much easier to defeat. It
                won't be easy to control human reproduction, partly
                because it's not even clear that it's a good idea.
                However, if we decide that this is what we want, then
                I'm not worried about humans evolving immunity to
                whatever policy we come up with. Memetics will win that
                arms race.

            Amish retention rates have increased over time by some
            pretty significant amounts. It's possible that something
            similar will happen with the Quiverfull folks. I'm dubious
            about the 80% figure, but I wouldn't count on it lasting
            over time. It's likely that what you're seeing as memetic
            capture is actually genetic boil-off.

        Sorry blacktrance -- that would interfere with currently ongoing
        attempt to breed the perfect client for the progressive state.

        One who is economically unproductive so can be bought cheaply.

        One who is violent and hostile to outsiders so can control
        territory where unlimited votes can be mined in times of need.

        One who will breed young and with low parental investment so
        that the children can parasitize resources away from the more
        expensive to raise children of the enemy.

        Sounds like the perfect eugenics program already. I can't
        imagine improving it in any way.

    That's it. That's the voice I heard, crying out to me in the
    wilderness, when I was six. That is the voice that I turned away
    from for "mere survival", because everyone around me literally had
    the rule "kill everyone who doesn't worship, appease, or hide from
    God".

    We need to kill God and take His stuff. In all seriousness: where do
    I sign up? And what do I have to offer?

        I've often dreamed in the last few years about writing a fantasy
        where a fallen angel leads Earth's nations to storm Heaven, kill
        the angels, tear God from His throne, and put him under a
        heavenly guillotine. Then destroy all the souls in Hell, if no
        other mercy can be given them than annihilation. Then I start
        reading angelology and demonology and get bored and write
        something else.\
        But it's still a fun way to shock street preachers when they
        say, "how can you disrespect your creator?"\
        But yes, where's the recruitment station for the army of Elua?

            It may not be quite what you are looking for, but someone
            has already written a lengthy piece of fiction about what
            would happen if Hell decided to invade earth and drag off
            everybody there. I normally don't like military fic, but I'd
            recommend this just for the heartwarming sight of all of
            humanity uniting together to kick the ass of the Devil and
            God, and succeeding. Featuring the Boeing YAL laser against
            the Angel of Death, Russian artillery against Beelzebub's
            army, an ex-terrorist truck bomber against one of the beasts
            of the apocalypse, James Randi finding out that tinfoil
            guards against demonic mind control, Bill Clinton killing a
            succubus, nerve gas and helicopters against harpies, the
            threat of nuclear weapons, famous cameos from history
            cameoing in hell, and other goodness.

            They aren't quite in order, but the first "book" is
            Armageddon??? and the second is Pantheocide. Read in order,
            chapterwise.\

                Yes, I second this. It might not be Nobel-winning
                literature but damn if it isn't entertaining. Naturalist
                warm fuzzies and Crowning Moments Of Awesome all around.

                Shame that the final part of the trilogy was never
                written due to some circumstances that are best
                summarized by "this is why we can't have nice things."

                The Salvation War is a great piece of gun porn with
                plentiful "Humanity, fuck yeah!" moments, but the HFY
                can't really salvage the story for me, because I get the
                distinct sense that it's trying to have its cake and eat
                it too.

                On the one hand, it wants to be the story of how humans
                encountered a tribe of fire-breathing, acid-spitting,
                lightning-farting ogres, and kicked ogre ass by having
                tank divisions, bomber planes, and other forms of [More
                Dakka](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka){rel="nofollow"}
                while the ogres were still struggling with this
                'gunpowder' business.

                On the other hand, it wants to be the story of how
                humans faced off in a world-threatening struggle against
                Satan, Prince of Darkness, Father of Lies, etc etc,
                ruler of the Nine Circles of Hell.

                These might not be incompatible, but they didn't work
                out in The Salvation War. When it ripped the mask from
                Satan's face to reveal that he was merely the biggest
                ogre in ogreville, it also ripped away most of what
                makes Satan and the hordes of hell threatening in the
                first place. The Father of Lies is a serious concern
                because, well, he *lies*, which implies extensive
                knowledge of human thoughts and desires and current
                state and how to argue and so forth, whereas the ogres
                featured in TSW seem to be utterly clueless about what
                the humans are up to.

                Revealing that (minor spoiler) [gur fhpphov ner
                eryrnfvat curebzbarf naq pna or pbhagrenpgrq jvgu
                nvepbaqvgvbavat](http://www.rot13.com/index.php){rel="nofollow"}
                has the same problem of reducing the capabilities of the
                ogres to brute force, rather than any kind of skill or
                control. Demons are supposed to tempt. Demons are
                supposed to know what humans want. Demons are supposed
                to see the sin in people's hearts. What humanity's
                facing here isn't demons, it's a tribe of red ogres
                called "demons". It could have worked as a demonstration
                of how millennia-old myths aren't as scary when you go
                in with modern weapons and hunt down the man behind the
                curtain, but then it should have consistently stripped
                Satan down to the man behind the curtain, not given him
                nine rings of Hell straight out of Dante's Inferno where
                Minos uses tail-wrapping to sort people at the entrance.
                It jars terribly.

                Related to the ogres-not-demons complaint is my
                impression that Hell is carrying an idiot ball regarding
                wider knowledge of what the humans are up to. The author
                tries to justify it with human society having been very
                slow to change for millennia and the demons getting lazy
                about checking, but I'm not buying it. First because
                human society did frequently change faster -- consider
                the Ottoman Empire, which expanded from Anatolia to
                seize Jerusalem, Alexandria and Mecca in a generation.
                Or the rise of Charlemagne, or Alexander the Great. Or
                the Mongols. History is rife with this sort of thing,
                and the demons still think it's acceptable to use
                fifty-year-old intelligence to select very important
                targets for their limited-use artillery. (And by
                "artillery" I don't even mean the five-hundred-year-old
                cannons that some enterprising demon could have picked
                up pretty much anywhere in Eurasia since the fall of
                Constantinople, I mean raining fire from the sky.) Then
                there are a few other matters like sending scouts,
                having the scouts disappear, and attacking blind because
                surely that's nothing to worry about.

                If he only hadn't issued the tin-foil hats in chapter
                three, all of those lies and wiles and temptations would
                have worked just fine, even as brute force. But no
                tactic the demons try is allowed to have even temporary
                success, except the lava flows. I read the whole thing,
                but I'm not going on to the second book.

                My objections are a little different, but I'm basically
                with Erik here. There's nothing wrong with the basic
                conceit ("by the standards of the starving Bronze Age
                goatherds that the Abrahamic religions derive from, we
                routinely do things beyond the ken of gods and devils"),
                and the plot would have worked fine as a short story of
                a twentieth the length. But to make it work at novel
                length you'd need to go beyond genre limitations, and it
                basically doesn't.

                It's not good milfic because the conflict's so
                overwhelmingly one-sided. It's not good fantasy because
                there's nothing interesting about the metaphysics, and
                nothing particularly original about the angels and
                demons or the societies they create. It's not good
                physical horror because there's no sense of threat, and
                it doesn't even try to go for psychological threats. But
                it *tries* to be standard milfic and fantasy and horror,
                leaning on genre tropes to the detriment of character
                and original worldbuilding, with the result that once
                the "humanity, fuck yeah" angle is exhausted --- and I
                do enjoy that, don't get me wrong --- you're left with
                some mediocre splatter, a few scenes obviously designed
                as what TV Tropes irritatingly calls a "moment of
                awesome", and nothing else.

                It would have been a better piece of work if the
                viewpoint characters were all or mostly angels and
                demons, although that's still fairly well-trodden
                ground.

                oh, i remember reading that. iirc it was pretty meh; the
                premise was nice, but the author dragged a short story's
                worth of content to fill a full volume (or two, i
                guess). especially grating were the constant
                spelling/grammar errors and obvious tract. it was
                entertaining for a few chapters, but beyond that it's so
                catastrophically boring that i'm surprised anyone
                manages to read both books.

                verdict: would've been good as a greentext, horrible as
                is

            I don't know what I have to offer MIRI. My income is
            currently barely below equilibrium, so donations are
            exceptionally painful in an "should I give to MIRI all the
            money I could otherwise invest in increasing my income?"
            sense. I used to be \*really\* smart and math-savvy, but I
            spent 20 years coding stupid business problems and playing
            monkey-politics and I overwrote those parts of my brain. I'm
            too low-status to be an effective leader or evangelist, and
            I suffer from acute depression that keeps me from going off
            and founding my own project and sticking with it long enough
            to attract the right talent.

            What do?

                I got the impression from the Open Thread that you had a
                thing for game design. A board/card game that teaches
                about Moloch's weird incentive structures, where one
                wins by advancing the goals of niceness, community, and
                civilization, would be an interesting teaching tool.

                To be fair, I was born into an environment where
                advanced critical thinking and mathematical ability
                weren't exactly compatible with inclusive fitness.
                Becoming dumber and less insightful was a survival
                mechanism.

        I had already updated in favor of Scott being a budding

                The Darth line was merely a quick shorthand for the old
                saw that no one is a villian in their own mind (and
                actual canon on Darth Vader doesn't refute it, because
                fictional).

                My point in the parent was that, while this was
                wonderfully interesting and illuminating, it also would
                not be surprising if Scott had concluded it with "and
                that is why I must now enslave humanity for its own
                good!"

            Nah, a bald psychiatrist from the decadent American
            Northeast who collects books in a cryptic language, is an
            expert in all kinds of mind-altering drugs, and talks about
            killing God would hardly make a good villain.

                Actually, a bald psychiatrist with an expertise in
                mind-altering drugs sounds VERY supervillainy.

                I wholeheartedly recommend this, as I can't be a hero
                without villains.

        Ironic. When I heard that voice in the wilderness, I assumed God
        -- Elua -- was \*offering\* us His tools, so we could help.

        (I guess in this analogy, Satan, the Prince Of This World, would
        be the "God" figure you're supposed to overthrow as His
        champion.)

            The most dangerous tool Moloch has is when he dresses up as
            Elua and says "You can have peace and joy and free love, but
            all you have to do is kill the tribe over the hill. All of
            them, down to the babies in the cradle."\
            Or "Those men who love other men aren't *really* loving or
            doing nything that's good for them, no matter how much they
            think they are. You don't want Moloch to *win,* do you?"\
            And men kill and Moloch laughs.

                Moloch never laughs. He doesn't care enough about the
                outcome to find it funny.

                Of course Moloch laughs. How else could we laugh with
                him?

                Sometimes. Sometimes it's Enki. And sometimes it's...
                oh, hell, do we have one for thede-binding yet?

                But Moloch is strong, and Enki is weak, and the nameless
                god was wounded in the war --- he lives on in the
                shadows and at the furthest remove, he wears the mask of
                Elua or Mammon, and when the cult of Cthulhu tries to
                call him up and harness his power, they lose him
                entirely and get Moloch instead.

                (...actually not sure what the gender of the nameless
                god is...)

                In this case Moloch's laughter sounds like AIDS, MRSA
                and drug resistant gonorrhea.

                You just wanted to be tolerant and nice? Too bad. Guess
                Elua loses another round.

                Maybe those ancient taboos had a damned good reason for
                sticking around.

                You really can't escape Gnon.

    FWIW, your third utopia more or less exists in Finland, Belgium,
    Estonia and Denmark. The implementations aren't perfect (for both
    technical and policy reasons), but practical goals like "I am in
    another city on a weekend and need to refill my migraine
    prescription while I can still stand up" are generally easy to
    satisfy. Granted, this is a lot easier with eleven million people
    rather than 318 million.

    I'm not sure your blockchain analogy really applies here. In
    Bitcoin, controlling 51% of the network's power means that you get
    to control "history" from that point forward --- you decide which
    transactions get written to the chain and which ones don't.
    Decentralised coordination to agree on a mathematical ground truth
    is only one kind of Byzantine-resistant coordination under
    uncertainty; in some situations [changing the way you
    coordinate](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.94.4421){rel="nofollow"}
    is enough to eliminate a traitor's opportunity to be treacherous.

    Have you looked at Toby Ord's [societal iterated prisoner's
    dilemma](http://amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/dilemma/index.html){rel="nofollow"}
    work? It's not exactly coordination and it's not at all under
    uncertainty, but it is an interesting look at how various strategies
    (expressed, basically, as functions of each player's knowledge of
    their own and other players' previous actions) perform against one
    another in terms of population over time. The graph where, out of a
    population of 650, a mere 100 Absolutists so thoroughly outperform
    everyone else that everyone else becomes an Absolutist before the
    game is half over is eye-opening.

    I did not like the Kipling.

    Coming off the reactionary stuff, how much of what we presently
    value is just value drift x mammon's favour? (and should we care?)
    It seems implausible that the western college-educated liberal
    cluster would be more human than everyone else. So, the things we
    like that the rest of humanity doesn't like -- free choice of
    gender/sexual/\* identity, the idea that it's ok to be icky as long
    as you're not hurting anyone else, that everyone is equal... are
    these just things that make us better capitalists than others? Are
    they values that the rest of the world would share if they had the
    spare resources that we do? Something else entirely?

        \> how much of what we presently value is just value drift x
        mammon's favour?

        Literally all of it -- our values are evolved in the first
        place.

        \> Are they values that the rest of the world would share if
        they had the spare resources that we do?

        I don't know the answer to this, but a relevant observation is
        that whenever one of my conservative Mormon friends deconverts
        -- they immediately become super supportive of gay rights and
        other things they previously opposed strongly. Obviously a large
        part of this is that 'gay rights' is very memetically fit, but I
        think it is also evidence that the answer to your question is
        yes. The reasoning is that a large number of people 'want' to be
        progressive, but this is contained by societal rules and taboos.
        Once the selection pressure for these taboos lets up (most
        likely because of bountiful resources) they quickly dissolve
        away.

        I think there's a fairly large consensus in the field of
        psychology that the whole "accepting people who are different"
        thing is caused primarily by resource security. Basically, if we
        feel secure we allow the better parts of our nature to come out.

        I should also note that the "values" you describe are more like
        "meta-values." They're values about what other people are
        allowed to value. (I.E. should people be allowed to be
        homosexual). I believe I have a strong moral obligation to
        respect peoples values'. I think I should respect what people
        chose to do with their lives. But I feel no such obligation for
        meta-values. If someone else disagrees with me and thinks that
        burning gay people alive is the way to go I have no obligation
        whatsoever to respect that.

            The worse parts of our nature.

            The part that says "it's easier to have everyone like me and
            never have to feel the empathic shame of shunning someone
            for destructive behavior (except for shaming and shunning
            people who shame and shun people for bad behavior) and if
            everyone acts this way then we can feel good all the time".

            Comfort doesn't force virtue because you can afford it --
            comfort allows vice because you don't need to have virtue to
            survive and virtue is hard.

                Why the requirement to shun people who shun people?
                Tolerate anything, including intolerant beliefs. Punish
                only those who attempt to inflict their will on other
                people directly.

                I tend to act as if people are all of equal value to me
                and as if I believe we should all be permitted to do
                anything we like as long as we don't directly harm
                nonconsenting people.

                I don't act this way because I believe it, (I don't) but
                because in meatspace if I primarily deal with the sort
                of people who either believe that or pretend they do, I
                can indulge all (well, most) of my vices and not suffer
                retribution or have to be secretive about it. There is
                no scenario in which an alternative to that situation
                would cause both an improvement in my freedom of action,
                AND less or equal effort, AND less or equal risk.

                Shunning people is not empathic pain, it's utterly
                trivial. Not doing so, on the other hand, is a very
                minor effort which gathers to me the sort of people who
                also do not shun people, who are therefore quite useful.

    Seconding Geirr; I believe this may very well be your magnum opus.
    It's **at least** as good as your earlier meditations on gender.

    Keep in mind that the plausibility of your plan to kill Gnon depends
    on hard take-off being possible. Superintelligence alone is not
    enough; a gradual slide into superintelligence will simply be
    corrupted by the horsemen.

    Even hard take-off can be threatened by competitive pressures.
    Imagine several teams working on FAI. And imagine that the team
    which is willing to be a little looser with its utility function can
    launch one month earlier than the rest.

    Which brings us back to the question of just what values the FAI is
    supposed to implement. You try to sweep all human values together
    under Elua, but the very mention of "free love" is already in
    opposition to what many consider important human values.

    Also, I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be "Nature **or** Nature's
    God"; that's why it's spelled with an "o".

        I've been thinking that as an alternative to FAI, we should just
        make an AI that enforces Scott's values. Or Ozy's. Or freaking
        anybody.

                Make a superintelligence that enforces the Joker's
                values. The Joker is basically my Elua. Actually, I
                might need to make that a new tumblr tag.

                No but seriously, I have thought this over and if I had
                the power to bring one imaginary god to life, it would
                be Teah, Joker God of Giving People What They Really
                Want As Limited Only By Making Sure Not To Fuck With
                Everyone Else Too Badly. Goodbye Malthus, goodbye
                Moloch, enter a new age of art and love and peace and
                joy. Because after all, what does Teah do if not satisfy
                people's values?

                I apologize to anyone who is unduly terrified by this
                comment, which I suspect I am not articulating with
                sufficient clarity to make it comprehensible to people
                who don't already know what I'm talking about.

                In the final analysis? I'm an ultra-leftist, so we can
                start with peace, equality, and fun and go from there.

                I would LOVE to see the face of someone turn on a
                superintelligence which had my values. I would be
                laughing for all of the week or so in which I and other
                human beings still existed before being disassembled for
                parts of a matrioshka brain.

            This is why I hope IA outpaces AI.

            I certainly think attempts to build a utilitarian FAI are
            misguided. Human values aren't utilitarian.

            And yeah, Scott is about the only person I'd trust as
            galactic dictator if I can't nominate myself.

                Agreed. Human values are aesthetic, not utilitarian.
                This is the root reason why utilitarians reject hedonium
                in favor of Coherent Extrapolated Volition -- a hedonium
                universe is *ugly*.

                CEV and CEV-like schemes are explicitly *not*
                utilitarian by the usual meaning of the word. You can
                think of them as laying out one scheme for resolving
                some of the issues with preference utilitarianism, but
                at that point it's unorthodox to the point of not really
                being the same thing.

                It's *definitely* not hedonic utilitarian, but that's a
                horribly broken ethic anyway.

    Posts like these are why I love your writing.

    Peto's Paradox (why don't whales die of cancer?) has a message,
    maybe an encouraging message, about coordination.

    The more complexity an entity or society contains, the more
    opportunities there are for coordination to pay off. Our present
    wealth and diversity implies also vastly increased opportunity for
    coordination.

    Whales are optimal with more anticancer systems than mice. Rich
    developed nations can afford more coordination mechanisms than
    hunter-gatherer tribes.

    We can see this in recent technology. Look how many of the Internet
    age's software and platforms are coordination systems! Consider
    Kickstarter, blogs, Hangouts, Wikipedia, schedule coordination on
    Google Calendar, or African farmers getting text messages with
    current market prices for their various crops.

    We can perform feats of coordination now that were impossible, even
    inconceivable, thirty years ago. So if you want to beat Moloch, the
    answer may already be out there, if we can just figure how to adapt
    or scale up some of these new tools.

    And "tools" is the right word, here. Coordination is not a miracle
    that falls from the sky. Kickstarter is a tool. Wikipedia is a tool.
    Representative democracy is a low-performance tool, but what do you
    expect for something that's been around for 200 years? Coordination
    is produced by technologies and tools, just like other things are.

    Yes, it's harder when there are larger rewards to "defecting." But
    it's not magically harder, just practically harder.

    Instead of saying "these new coordination tools are irrelevant,
    because they have no enforcement angle," we should be saying "look
    how much we've been able to start doing without any significant
    enforcement! Imagine what we can do if and when we add in even a
    little contract-enforcement capacity into our new coordination
    tools."

    Imagine a more sophisticated successor to Kickstarter, call it
    "pothole-filler", where the campaign includes multiple bidders for
    the raised money and an arbitrator who releases the money at
    performance milestones. That looks an awful lot like the ability to
    get people to mutually contract to pay taxes to pay for any social
    goal they like. Including, say, security officers to enforce prior
    contracts. So our existing coordination platforms are already pretty
    darn close to being able to reproduce existing government, for
    example.

    We live in an age of burgeoning coordination platforms. If the goal
    is to slay Moloch, that's worth paying attention to.

        I'd definitely like to see the Kickstarter/Indiegogo model used
        more in local government, crowdfunding new play equipment for a
        park or something, but I can also see ways it can go wrong --
        Beverly Hills getting gold-plated sidewalks that get polished
        every day, but Compton not able to get a water pipe fixed. I
        certainly wouldn't want to let people bid on the services of
        police officers, otherwise "Kickstarter: Round Up The \[insert
        minority here\] And Send Them To Prison Camps" becomes a real
        possibility.

                Truthcoin, which you've mentioned before, could be used
                for something the author terms "trustless dominant
                assurance contracts" or T-DACs. The idea is to use the
                incentive-distorting effects of these bets in a positive
                way to fund public goods. So people who want something,
                (the canonical example being a lighthouse) can bet
                \*against\* it being built, both as a kind of insurance
                and as an incentive for people betting on the other side
                to construct the lighthouse.

                I don't know how well this would actually work in
                practice, but it's certainly an *interesting* potential
                coordination technology.

        That is indeed the case but is not nearly the whole story.

        Now people feel no guilt about breaking plans at the last
        possible second because they can use fancy communication
        technology to inform the person without ever having to speak to
        them.

        Coordination technology improved and it eroded social norms that
        allowed for coordination resulting in a society where it's
        harder than ever to coordinate plans.

            If people routinely cancel on you for no good reason...that

            Certainly not my experience, though it probably varies by
            social circle. I wonder if any studies have been done on
            this?

        The Cochran-Ewald view is that cancer is most likely caused by
        pathogens rather than mutations which are random outcomes for
        each cell. Whales either have better defenses, or perhaps their
        social structure results in less exposure.

            Gorbunova and co. have written a series of fascinating
            papers comparing cancer across species, with a focus
            primarily on rodents. Here are a couple of them:

            [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00431.x/full](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00431.x/full){rel="nofollow ugc"}

            [http://www.pnas.org/content/109/47/19392.full](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/47/19392.full){rel="nofollow ugc"}

            [http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v15/n8/full/nrg3728.html](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v15/n8/full/nrg3728.html){rel="nofollow ugc"}

            Thoughts arising therefrom:

            First: Naked mole rats get exceptional cancer protection
            from an interaction between unusually large hyaluronan
            molecules and p16, which provides a redundant pathway (in
            addition to the p27 pathway, which they share with most
            other mammals) for enforcing a minimum distance between
            cells. Blind mole rats, by contrast, get their cancer
            protection from p53 and Rb working with IFN-β to cause
            necrotic cell death when cells get too close. Eastern grey
            squirrels use yet another method. Beavers use telomere
            shortening, which is common among large mammals but not
            found in any of the long-lived small rodents.

            In other words, there are many ways to get cancer
            protection. Add redundancy to one of any number of pathways,
            and you've multiplied your cancer protection many-fold.

            Second: Mice, rats and voles suffer high mortality from
            starvation, predation and disease. They also have the
            feeblest cancer protections among rodents. By contrast,
            naked mole rats, blind mole rats, eastern grey squirrels and
            beavers have all found ways to ensure a reliable food supply
            and protect themselves from predators: Burrowing, jumping
            through the trees, building lodges, keeping food underground
            or under water. There's a strong argument to be made that
            these things came \~before\~ they gained additional cancer
            protections, and were the ultimate cause of the cancer
            protection.

            Why? It's because avoiding cancer only helps those who die
            of old age. For mice, rats and voles, the selective signal
            on an anti-cancer mutations gets lost in the noise of early
            death from many other causes. It's only for already
            long-lived animals, protected from predation and starvation,
            that cancer prevention leads to more offspring for one
            individual versus another and allows an anti-cancer mutation
            to become fixed in a population.

            In other words, whales probably avoid cancer \~because\~
            they live a long time.

    You don't give any consideration to the possibility of Moloch
    getting stuck on local minima as he pushes us downstream. This
    offers an avenue of solutions that don't require gardening. We could
    sacrifice our hands first, so that we would be unable to chop off
    our legs or cut out our eyes, or the eyes of our children.
    Precommitment mechanisms are relevant here, but I get the feeling
    there are other potentially relevant mechanisms as well, ones not
    only related to Moloch's values but also to his capabilities and
    limits. At the worst, if forced to choose between becoming Morloch's
    Borg and human extinction, I would push the red button, that other
    planets might live. But, I don't know if real sacrifices of any kind
    will be necessary, provided that we're extraordinarily diligent in
    anticipating Morloch's demands and constraining ourselves so he
    can't have them.

    For whatever reason, I'm reminded of the book The Self-Made
    Tapestry, which I'm currently in the middle of reading. It talks a
    lot about constraints on optimization, optimization not only in the
    context of evolving life but in the context of all sorts of
    replicators, including patterns of matter in general, for example
    foams.

    I think you think markets and evolution are more efficient than they
    really are, though of course you don't say exactly how efficient you
    think they are. Not that I believe Moloch isn't terrifying, it's
    just that he operates in certain ways that I think we should
    understand more precisely. Everyone always gives lip service to the
    inefficiency of the market and stupidity of evolution, but most
    people consider it to be trivial, worth ignoring. I'd question that
    common assumption. I think efficiency is the exception.

    I also think competition is the exception. Moloch is terrifying, but
    a singleton who doesn't need to make any sacrifices seems more
    likely to me. Advantages tend to accumulate, and aren't
    automatically equally distributed, so usually one agent quickly
    outcompetes many others and achieves dominance. One lucky whale
    carcass, and soon you're taking over the ocean (not really, but, you
    know).

    On the other hand, you ignore group selection, Moloch's kryptonite.
    I thought group selection was stupid until two weeks ago, when I
    learned it doesn't apply if members of competing groups can
    replicate. That was a major shock. You're aware of multilevel
    selection's modern legitimacy, right?

    One problem you ignore is that Moloch doesn't exist on only one
    level. Moloch lives in both the garden and the gardener. We might
    set up a government to solve collective action problems, but then
    the government itself will be vulnerable to collective action
    problems. I don't think this regression is always necessarily
    intractable, but it's at the very least an extremely difficult
    problem requiring clever thought and creative solutions.

    I think it would be interesting to make Moloch fight himself. We
    could use one Moloch to guard against another, and hide in the space
    between their struggle. If it wasn't worth their while to find us,
    they wouldn't look. This is essentially the idea of democracy, I
    guess, though it might need a revision to help deal with the
    influence of special interests. But I'm thinking less in the vein of
    having one party oppose another, and more in the vein of having
    memetics that directly counter biology, and vice versa. Splitting
    Morloch seems more practical to me than trying to summon Elua,
    though both are currently worthwhile avenues of inquiry.

    Memetics is really scary sometimes. I need to read more about it.

    Finally, I'm not at all familiar with Bataille, but I have some
    friends who are. Reading this post reminded me of my vague
    impressions of Bataille. You might consider reading him sometime, if
    you can find the patience for it.

        > *We might set up a government to solve collective action

        Indeed. I'd expect to find "here's why the tragedy of the
        commons sucks" in \*pro\*-libertarian essays, as an introduction
        to the need for property rights, not in anti-libertarian essays,
        as an introduction to the need for creating a more
        all-encompassing commons.

        (the pro-libertarian versions would be more entertaining, too;
        Malthus' Moloch still tries to overwhelm any holdout rats, for
        example, but he's screaming "end inequality!" and "we are the
        99%!" while he does it)

        If freedom doesn't work on goods which are costly,
        non-excludable, and non-rivalrous, which of those attributes
        doesn't describe your conception of government? The
        neo-reactionary solution of "so get rid of the freedom to vote"
        is pretty stupid, but at least they're not ignorant of the
        problem.

            I think the solution, generally, is to try to make sure the
            agents enforcing agreements are always different from the
            agents making agreements. Farmers should not be allowed to
            influence our farms bill, politicians should not decide the
            elections process, etc.

        This. Unfortunately, it doesn't get us very far toward a
        solution. Especially because the kind of evolution we're worried
        about -- memetic -- is not so blind. (Memes rule, genes drool,
        doncha know.) Mutation is no longer randomly oriented with
        respect to fitness. Meme fitness (defined in purely evolutionary
        terms) is now an important subgoal, or extremely closely aligned
        to a subgoal, of many of the meme-tweakers.

    This is probably the best thing you have written, even exceeding the
    Graduation Speech essay, because it is one of the very few things
    that really gets across, on a gut level, the feeling of staring at a
    vast and terrifying thing.

    The sort of thing Lovecraft was trying to get across, before the
    internet got to his work.

    The sense of deep time induced by the [Universal Death
    Clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1CddzgVW14){rel="nofollow"}.

    Any serious attempt to contemplate the distance between stars or the
    total suffering of all the creatures that have ever lived on the
    planet.

    It's one of the few moments where I can actually have feelings about
    something that approximately match how important the thing is, so I
    want to figure out what makes it happen so it can be paired with
    things that have their significance underestimated.

        What Anon said.

        > "Gnon" is short for "Nature And Nature's God", except the A is
        > changed to an O and the whole thing is reversed, because
        > neoreactionaries react to comprehensibility the same way as
        > vampires to sunlight.

        It's "Nature Or Nature's God", and the reversed abbreviation
        isn't because "neoreactionaries" in general dislike
        comprehensibility, it's because Nick Land is nuts and likes him
        some crypto-cabbalism and numerology and I don't know what.
        Moldbug likes being verbose, and with those two being prolific,
        the movement is off to a bad start.

        Although I do sympathize that "Nong" sounds like I'm about to
        make a series of terrible puns involving the adoption of
        Vietnamese currency by a Special Administrative Region of China,
        resulting in the Hong Kong Dong, while "Gnon" sounds more like
        an entity.

    This is exceptionally powerful! I thought a couple things while I
    was finishing up.

    The first was: Apollo. That's the name that the Greeks gave to the
    good god. For the Norse, I suppose it would be Baldur. A
    surprisingly recurrent theme in myth.

    The second was: Oh, THAT'S why people think that transhumanism is
    bad/psychotic/nihilistic, and why skynet is always the bad guy in
    pop media. The machine becomes a literal incarnation of Moloch, at
    least insofar as Moloch is vaguely recognized and hated.

    The third was: this is an awful lot of mythological metaphor. That
    analogy probably has to break down at some point, and I fully expect
    myself to be terrible at knowing where the edge of the god-metaphor
    domain actually is.

        Apollo was not the Greek God of goodness. He was the God of
        healing, but also sickness. He was the God of prophecy -- but
        his oracles usually deliberately misled. He was the god of
        archery, but he used that for harm as well as help. He was the
        God of music, but not in any unambiguously positive way. Unlike
        Elua, he was definitely not the God of love or niceness (which,
        by the way, the Greeks did not think had much to do with each
        other).

        Consider Apollo's actions in the Iliad. These are not the
        actions of the "good God." These are the actions of a terrible
        (in the true sense) God, who sends a plague on the Greeks
        because they do not show him proper respect, and slays their
        greatest hero because he is their enemy.

            Apollo and Dionysus together, perhaps?

            Or Prometheus, from a certain perspective, though Prometheus

        You are totally right about this. This is, in fact, why I have
        spent most of my life as Not a Transhumanist, or at least as
        firmly opposed to technology.

    Will take a few days to digest this, but I'd like to thank you and
    disagree with at least part of your diagnosis.

    First, thank you for including my absolute favorite quotation of all
    time: Principia Discordia "A Sermon on Ethics and Love".

    Second, I'm not sure lack of coordination is the problem. It's
    deeper than that -- it's not that individuals don't know how to make
    agreements or agree on shared sacrifices, it's that most of us don't
    actually want to make those sacrifices. Humans are individuals,
    programmed at very deep levels to compete rather than cooperating.

    The first Solstice I made was framed around Lovecraftian horrors. I
    did that on purpose -- the metaphors seemed horrifying poignant to
    me. Alas, two things:

    1\) Nobody else especially resonated with the Lovecraft metaphors

    2\) It was my first attempt at a Solstice, so a lot of the art was
    less polished.

    I think you would do a better job than I at creating a Solstice
    ceremony that took people into the darkness and stared Moloch in the
    face. You mentioned, a while ago, you might consider doing a
    Solstice for Michigan. I think you should.

        I went to last year's Solstice, and Lovecraftian horrors are
        especially terrifying to me. I'm not sure whether I would have
        loved or hated having that Solstice be more like the first.

            Not yet. It is possible I'm doing some kind of tour between
            Boston, San Fran and NY, if I can make it happen.

            I actually think the general principle here,
            sans-Moloch-as-primary-metaphor, might make a good general
            theme for a Solstice, but I'd consider traveling to see a
            non-public Solstice that pushed the idea to the limit.

            I ran a very crude, first pass version of a
            Ceremony-inspired-by-this yesterday (basically just using
            the entire essay as a script). It would need a lot of work
            to actually create the desired, polished effect, but the
            idea definitely shows promise.

    One might characterize this as inverse-Hobbesian. After we developed

    Maybe "Elua" ultimately serves Moloch? That is, we value flowers,
    free love, soft and fragile things, art, science, philosophy, love,
    niceness, community, and civilization because they demonstrate
    intelligence, make us more attractive to others, improve our
    breeding success, make us better respected by others, make us more
    successful and more powerful?

        Would be better to say that Elua serves Moloch initially. These

            So Moloch, embodiment of the nature of reality, creates
            Elua, purely incidentally, as he has created so many other
            things. But somehow Elua is unique among his creations, and
            eventually develops a will of his own to go against Moloch.

            It's basically Paradise Lost, innit?

                of the constraints right now seem to be various
                optimization processes fighting over territory.

                I suppose this is a bit off-topic, but I read a lot of
                fantasy, and I'm occasionally struck by how much more
                compelling fantasy religions that're basically Christian
                heresies are than the fabricated polytheisms that are
                more traditional in the genre. No doubt cultural
                resonance has a hand in this, but I don't think it's
                *personal* bias; I was raised secular.

                Narnia may be an exception, though. For all C.S. Lewis's
                reputation as a Christian apologist, I still think the
                land of Narnia is short one well-deserved lionskin rug.

        *we value flowers ... because they ... make us ... more
        powerful?*

        Psychological "because" is not the evolutionary "because". If
        evolution made us like X, because it statistically contributed
        to Y which evolution wanted, we will continue to like X even
        when it stops contributing to Y. The plan is to remove all
        undesired Y's, and keep all the nice X's.

        We can keep liking flowers, even when the sacrifices to gain
        more power stop.

    "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet
    forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their
    soul?" Matthew 6:26

    You're halfway to our side already, Scott Alexander. Trust that
    there will be cookies. Not that I can promise cookies. But if
    cookies can exist at all, they are with us, the mystics (Christian
    mystic cookies are also the undisputed best flavor!)

    Or if bible quotes turn you all off, and you'll like something more
    whimsical to lift you from these heavy thoughts, how about Buffy the
    vampire slayer?

    Billy Fordham: "I'm in. I will become immortal. "

    Buffy: "Well, I've got a news flash for you, brain trust. That's not
    how it works. You die, and a demon sets up shop in your old house,
    and it walks, and it talks, and it remembers your life, but it's not
    you."

    These silly neoreactionaries are just wannabe Moloch-worshipers.
    Like particularly dumb Cthulhu cultists who think there's any room
    for them in Cthulhu's world: I've got a news flash for you, brain
    trust. That won't be you. If you sacrifice everything about yourself
    worth preserving, it won't be you. And in the end, that thing you
    desperately tried to turn into will still die (even without a Buffy
    there to drive a stake through your heart).

    So you might as well try to turn into something you WANT to be.
    Something that would DESERVE not dying, even if things don't look
    ideal on that front.

        Would Christian mysticism be down with the polyamory and
        non-binary girlfriend, though?\
        This is roughly my response to being told that I'm 90% of the
        way to being a Christian because I identify strongly with Martin
        Luther King and the 19th century abolitionists and I think of
        the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" as a social justice hymn. MY
        objection is that I'd be a Christian if I could identify *even a
        little* with the text itself -- the Original Sin, the
        patriarchal bullshit, the opposition to homosexuality, Paul's
        command to women to be silent in church... these people, mostly
        one particular preacher at my school, have said that I secretly
        agreed with them, therefore I had to give up everything I love
        -- my not-Christian lover, my atheist family, my friends who are
        gay or polyamorous or trans. And it's just as incomprehensible.\
        So for me, I still reject Christianity even if I embrace a few
        of its byproducts, and I'll be content with my agnostic
        brownies.

            To be fair, his nonbinary girlfriend is ninety percent of
            the way to Christianity already. Specifically, to
            Desmond-Tutu-and-tea-with-the-vicar Anglicanism.
            Unfortunately, the whole "you have to believe an actual God
            actually exists and is not just a nice metaphor" thing seems
            to be a bit of an irreconcilable difference.

                Certainly literal belief in Christ would feel like an
                indecent and scandalous proposal to the stereotypical
                old-timey Anglican vicar.

            Well, I can't speak for the personification of Christian
            mysticism, but I don't see why it would be impossible.

            King Solomon was fairly polyamorous, after all; and
            respecting the non-binary, girlfriend or not, seems like a
            pretty clear-cut application of Doing Unto Others.

    This is a very good post. That said, I think Moloch is weaker than
    you describe. He must be, or we'd be dead like those artistic rats.
    He's not an Elder God, he's a Norse-tier god, and can be killed by a
    large enough wolf or snake. I'm an optimist on this one, and I don't
    have time to really do justice to why right now.

    I agree on Nick Land, though. It seems like he wants to summon a
    \*real\* Elder God that he's identified with the relatively-cuddly
    Moloch, and that's A Problem.

        I have much the same optimism and kept thinking as I read along
        that this argument *proves too much*. It's not a historical
        accident that Malthus was wrong. If the argument here were
        correct, Malthus would have been right. But he was wrong, and he
        was wrong for reasons, and those reasons should give us some
        hope here as well.

        On the flip side, the suckiness of our government is not
        contingent; it is essential. The ship of state is inherently
        hard to steer and accumulates barnacles. It can never truly be
        fixed. Perhaps the most promising option is to throw out the
        whole mess and start over again every few centuries.

        The government is a bit like certain incarnations of Internet
        Explorer or Microsoft Word -- each new feature that is added
        legitimately helps at least one person who wants that new
        feature but can't help but make the program a bit more complex
        and harder to use and harder to maintain and more expensive for
        everybody else. Diminishing returns limits the good you can do
        with government. The first law passed does a lot more good than
        the ten-thousandth one and eventually you reach an equilibrium
        where most laws cause at least as much damage as benefit.
        (Another option is to find a way *around* government so that it
        becomes irrelevant, as IE has.)

    Stirring; but, stated with too little restraint at the end.

    Your radical contrast between "Moloch" and "Elua" raises red flags
    to me. I do not think things can be that cleanly separated. I think,
    if Moloch was inextricably implicated in the origins of our values,
    then it must always have some living role in our values, however
    small. Otherwise our (conscious ideas of our) values will become
    ill-grounded, hollow and artificial, defined by opposition rather
    than determined from their own organic principle, and inevitably
    break down upon extrapolation. (And then perhaps Moloch will take
    hidden power within the range of evolutionary freedom granted by the
    artificiality, and within the freedom from scrutiny granted by the
    defined opposition.)

    Even so, a correctly designed singleton-process, even if conceived
    as "killing Moloch dead", would be self-correcting on this point. It
    would invent arguments like I gesture towards here, and correctly
    evaluate and react to whatever significance the arguments had. But
    take care that you do not
    ([somehow](http://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf#page=19){rel="nofollow"})
    build political momentum toward a singleton-process which was
    incorrectly designed.

    *Bostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a
    dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the
    leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered.*

    I read somewhere that George Lucas originally intended there to be a
    big reveal near the end of *Return of the Jedi* that the Emperor was
    actually a mostly powerless figurehead, and the Empire's real evil
    came from the billion faceless bureaucrats who actually carried out
    the day-to-day business of the Empire. Supposedly this was changed
    because it made it too hard to have a big climactic fight scene wrap
    everything up.

    The Imperial Administratum in Warhammer 40k works like this, not
    sure if it's a direct homage or not.

            Furthermore there's an actual line in *A New Hope* about how

            would be a very odd thing to include if Lucas' plan was for
            them to be the Real Evil All Along. Then again, Lucas is
            sorta infamous for changing his plans and then claiming his
            later plan was the Real Plan All Along, so...

                Well, what was actually said (by Grand Moff Tarkin) was
                that he had dissolved the \*Senate\*. Then somebody else
                (General Tagge) \*interprets\* this as eliminating the
                bureaucracy. That right there doesn't make much sense,
                since you can obviously have a bureaucracy without a
                Senate. (But Tagge is supposed to be a smart guy; he's
                the only one who understands the threat posed by the
                Rebel Alliance. So presumably he knows what he's talking
                about.)

        Supposedly the novelization of "A New Hope" portrayed the
        Emperor as a powerless figurehead (or at least, showed people
        who thought he was a powerless figurehead). By the time Return
        of the Jedi was made, Lucas had, apparently, changed things
        around a bit...

            I read that novelization (after seeing the movies) and I
            remember well that what you say is true. I reconciled it to
            myself at the time, because it only says that in a quotation
            from The Journal of the Whills, and who says that this
            journal is accurate? Later I found out that the Journal is
            supposed to be the source of all of George Lucas's
            information on the Star Wars galaxy (much as Tolkien learnt
            about the War of the Ring by translating the Red Book of
            Westmarch), which restores the problem ... but for all I
            know, that's not canonical anymore.

        Any change must have occurred in time for the Empire Strikes
        Back. There is a scene there where Vader and the Emperor
        (appearing only in holographic silhouette and not yet played by
        Ian McDiarmid) confer over how to respond to Luke. Vader calls
        the Emperor 'my Master', the Emperor thinks that Luke would make
        'a powerful ally' 'if he could be turned'; he's already the
        Emperor that know.

    ::: comment-body
    Moloch (and the capitalist bit in particular) reminded me of this
    bit in Nick Harkaway's 'The Gone-Away World' (also in general one of
    my favourite books ever: although it's much more action-packed and
    ninja-including than the quote below might suggest)

    "Suppose you are Alfred J. Fingermuffin, capitalist. You own a
    factory, and your factory uses huge industrial metal presses to make
    Fingermuffin Thingumabobs. Great big blades powered by hydraulics
    come stomping down on metal ribbon (like off a giant roll of tape,
    only made of steel) and cut Thingumabobs out like gingerbread men.
    If you can run the machine at a hundred Thingumabobs per minute, six
    seconds for ten Thingumabobs (because the machine prints ten at a
    time out of the ribbon), then you're doing fine. The trouble is that
    although in theory you could do that, in fact you have to stop the
    machine every so often so that you can check the safeties and change
    shifts.

    Each time you do, the downtime costs you, because you have the
    machine powered up and the crew are all there (both crews, actually,
    on full pay). So you want to have that happen the absolute minimum
    number of times per day. The only way you can know when you're at
    the minimum number of times is when you start to get accidents. Of
    course, you're always going to get some accidents, because human
    beings screw up; they get horny and think about their sweethearts
    and lean on the Big Red Button and someone loses a finger. So you
    reduce the number of shifts from five to four, and the number of
    safety checks from two to one, and suddenly you're much closer to
    making Fingermuffin's the market leader. Mrs Fingermuffin gets all
    excited because she's been invited to speak at the WI, and all the
    little Fingermuffins are happy because their daddy brings them
    brighter, shinier, newer toys. The downside is that your workers are
    working harder and having to concentrate more, and the accidents
    they have are just a little worse, just a little more frequent. The
    trouble is that you can't go back, because now your competitors have
    done the same thing and the Thingumabob market has gotten a bit more
    aggressive, and the question comes down to this: how much further
    can you squeeze the margin without making your factory somewhere no
    one will work? And the truth is that it's a tough environment for
    unskilled workers in your area and it can get pretty bad.

    Suddenly, because the company can't survive any other way,
    soft-hearted Alf Fingermuffin is running the scariest, most
    dangerous factory in town. Or he's out of business and Gerry Q.
    Hinderhaft has taken over, and everyone knows how hard Gerry Q.
    pushes his guys. In order to keep the company alive, safeguard his
    family's happiness and his employees' jobs, Alf Montrose
    Fingermuffin (that's you) has turned into a monster. The only way he
    can deal with that is to separate himself into two people -- Kindly
    Old Alf, who does the living, and Stern Mr Fingermuffin, factory
    boss. His managers do the same. So when you talk to Alf
    Fingermuffin's managers, you're actually not talking to a person at
    all. You're talking to a part in the machine that is Fingermuffin
    Ltd, and (just like the workers in the factory itself) the ones who
    are best at being a part are the ones who function least like a
    person and most like a machine. At the factory this means doing
    everything at a perfect tempo, the same way each time, over and over
    and over. In management it means living profit, market share and
    graphs. The managers ditch the part of themselves which thinks, and
    just get on with running the programme in their heads."

        \^ Exactly how Marx described what alienation means for the

        the best half your employees go get jobs elsewhere, and between
        that and your trashed reputation your business is ruined.

        The nice thing about an economic system which runs on greed is
        that you hardly have to fear it getting corrupted by greed, you
        just have to fear changes in supply and demand. When leftists
        worry that employers will fire everyone as soon as robot
        replacements are good enough, that's actually much \*less\*
        science fictional than the worry that employers will suddenly
        drop everyone to minimum wage (as soon as they figure out it's
        legal, I guess?).

    Very good essay. Not a lot of new material for those who follow the
    debate, but an excellent emotionally loaded one stop shop for the
    friendly AI meme.

    Comments

    Is the current triumph of Elua a permanent feature of the world or
    an aberration? Even away from our little corner of the net, people
    are talking about the setting of the atlantic powers and the rise of
    the more traditional societies, the BRICS bank and all. Hollywood is
    currently modifying content to satisfy the chinese market. Will this
    lead to such change that content with traditional values will
    dominate in a few years?

    Isn't Elua subject to dilutions of its own? In Eliezer's three
    worlds collide, the compromise formula means the values of others
    get adopted more and more, leaving the original peace and love
    formula a smaller and smaller part of the utility function?

                However, it might be prudent to note that Athens has
                also launched the [first imperial attempt to shore up a

                and it ended in a total disaster.

                That whole Sicilian episode feels very modern in an
                incredibly surreal way.

    This sentiment recalls the philosopher-kings of Plato's

    Here is a thing that follows very very obviously from the piece, and
    yet is not explicitly stated in the piece AFAICT:

    Making a friendly AI is a classic Moloch sacrifice scenario:\
    There are several projects trying to make strong AI, and whichever
    project achieves recursive self-improvement first, 'wins'. Thus
    there can be only one 'winner', and the AI projects are in very
    strong competition with one another.\
    Making AI in general is easier than making Friendly AI, which means
    Friendliness is something you can sacrifice in exchange for faster
    progress. Any project that expends resources on making sure their AI
    is Friendly will be beaten to the punch by one which does not.

    So coordinating between AI research projects is The Pivotal Battle.
    If we defeat Moloch here, we have a chance to defeat him for good.
    If he wins this battle, he wins the war.

    So, uh... what's the battle plan?

        There isn't one. Either we get UFAI which behaves in the way
        which is most sensible given that it is basically an
        all-powerful God, and we all die very quickly with nothing to
        mourn us, or we get FAI which is somehow neutered to behave as
        we would all like other people to behave, and we win the
        universe.

        AI is a hard problem, but not that hard. FAI is a very, very
        hard problem, so we're about as screwed as it's possible to be.
        We do, however, get the extreme (if short-lived) satisfaction of
        knowing that it was us who destroyed the universe. That's not
        nothing, if anyone's keeping score from outside.

                I don't think that's a solution. If I, personally, were
                an AI I would be considered profoundly UnFriendly; my
                implementation of this is limited only by technology and
                funds. Assuming that even one or two of the very rich
                people who would be first to acquire cybernetic
                enhancement had similar goals to mine, I would rate the
                survival prospects of everyone else in the low weeks, at
                most. Since there is a known correlation between
                business success (i.e. wealth) and psychopathy,
                cybernetics have some quite terrifying implications.

                I agree with that analysis more or less. Inequality
                becomes much worse if billionaires have cybernetics and
                normal people don't. But, I prefer that world to one
                with an FAI. I think the billionaire would eventually
                give away the technology, or die, or have their
                descendants outcompete the normals, or have technology
                stolen from them, so we'd enter an equal society in the
                long run.

                (I don't think that cybernetics will make the
                billionaire so strong that they can never be overcome by
                any normal human. Technology isn't magic, we won't ever
                have infinite energy.)

                Additionally, I want to fight inequality now, before the
                new technologies show up, because I agree an unequal
                takeoff would be bad news.

                There is of course a reasonable chance the billionaire
                takes over everything. But I consider that outcome
                preferable to nonexistence. If the billionaire kills
                everyone, at least there is a vaguely human singleton
                rather than a machine singleton. And since this path
                gives us at least a higher chance of utopia than the FAI
                attempt, in my opinion, it's really a clear win all
                around -- lower magnitude risks, higher probability
                success.

                I think you're probably somewhat unfriendly, but that
                you're less unfriendly than an FAI attempt would be. Why
                would you destroy the world? I also think that
                unfriendliness potential will be mitigated if multiple
                agents get enhancements.

                I would destroy the world because if I'm the first to

                Earth and its population would disappear in the first

            I like how you say that as if it meant "impossible".

                I don't. It's not even close to impossible. It's just
                (in my estimation) at least two orders of magnitude
                harder than General AI with a nonspecific utility
                function.

        Work on Friendliness separately and hopefully solve it before
        the AGI problem itself is solved. Then share the results with
        all the individual AI projects.

        ...at least that's the impression I have. I'm not exactly part
        of the cause; add salt as needed.

        What Error said plus

        1\. Raise awareness so that as high a percentage as posssible of
        AI researchers smart enough to make significant progress
        understand the importance of FAI.

        2\. Form a single team of FAI-aware AI researchers. Make sure
        they are as smart as possible.

        3\. Not share any breakthroughs that could be used to make
        unfriendly AI with the other AI teams.

        4\. Hope that your team is smart enough to beat the others, even
        while being much more careful.

    *13. Government corruption. I don't know of anyone who really
    thinks, in a principled way, that corporate welfare is a good idea.
    But the government still manages to spend somewhere around
    (depending on how you calculate it) \$100 billion dollars a year on
    it -- which for example is three times the amount they spend on
    health care for the needy. Everyone familiar with the problem has
    come up with the same easy solution: stop giving so much corporate
    welfare. Why doesn't it happen?*

    What? Medicaid spending is over 430 Billion dollars (2012). Federal
    spending is over half of that... If you include Medicare that more
    than doubles.

    Unless I'm missing something?

        You are correct I believe, I noticed this mistake too. Medicare
        is big.

        Additionally, I do know people who think corporate welfare is a
        good thing... but that is only because of war.

    Thank you for writing this. Unfortunately, I'm not as good at
    engaging with really huge abstract concepts through metaphor as I'd
    like to be, so I'm just going to straight-up ask:

    Does lifting Elua to Heaven specifically mean building Friendly AI?
    Or is it meant to be broader than that?

    I'd like to think that other actions that make the world better in
    some small measure count too.

    I just want to nth that this is some of the best stuff you've
    written.

    I'm particularly impressed with the depiction of the Moloch
    character being a physical embodiment of my discomfort with
    statements like, "Capitalism / Patriarchy / Government is a system
    which disadvantages everyone and everyone would be better off if it
    disappeared". Even if that were true, it's not the real issue.

    "To the orthodox there must always be a case for revolution; for in
    the hearts of men God has been put under the feet of Satan. In the
    upper world hell once rebelled against heaven. But in this world
    heaven is rebelling against hell. For the orthodox there can always
    be a revolution; for a revolution is a restoration."\
    -C.K. Chesterton "Orthodoxy"

    "Christianity agrees with Dualism that this universe is at war. But
    it does not think this is a war between independent powers. It
    thinks it is a civil war, a rebellion, and that we are living in a
    part of the universe occupied by the rebel.

    Enemy-occupied territory---that is what this world is. Christianity
    is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say
    landed in disguise, and is calling us all to take part in a great
    campaign of sabotage."\
    -C.S. Lewis "Mere Christianity"

    Is it me or did Scott just spend however long it took to write this
    colossus proving Chesterton and Lewis's impression of Christianity?

        Only if you believe that Christianity is everything good, and
        that everything good is Christianity.

        Christianity has also sacrificed some value to Moloch in
        exchange for getting more power. All the witches burned,
        heretics killed, children abused, etc.

        If we ignore this all, then yeah, Christianity is good. But if
        we are already going so far, why not ignore the whole
        Christianity, and just say that people have the capacity to be
        good?

            Pleeppleep is referring explicitly to Christianity as
            interpreted by Chesterton and Lewis, not all sorts of
            Christianities that ever have existed.

            They are right that there is similarity. This is basically
            the problem of evil, reformulated as to be relevant to
            atheists (as it should be), and SA's "atheodicy" is
            surprisingly similar to these Christian writers'.

            This makes no sense. The *witches* were the ones
            (putatively) getting their power from Moloch.

                Moloch as defined in the post is the search for
                efficiency-- witches were defined as using malevolent
                magic, which is a chaotic force.

                Nancy, I have trouble understanding your argument. Are
                you saying that malevolence is opposed to efficiency?
                Because I think the post says that the search for
                efficiency produces a whole lot of malevolence. (Or to
                paraphrase Clarke, a sufficiently advanced disregard
                indistinguishable therefrom...)

                The fish farm example of the race to the bottom can be
                mapped to witchcraft in that the putative witch is
                playing a negative-sum game, hurting the other members
                of the community. The core accusation of witchcraft,
                phrased in LW-ish language, goes something like "You
                sold out to a distant hostile agent in order to get the
                ability to injure the nearby members of your community
                so you could get ahead. This is bad and we will punish
                you for it." I don't see how it changes anything to call
                this chaotic -- it's still a sacrifice to Moloch, giving
                up personal integrity for power.

                Uh, no. Recommend some actual reading on the subject,
                for example,
                this. You really shouldn't take the persecutors word for
                what was actually going on.
                Oversimplifying somewhat, the reality is that the
                illiterate peasant class maintained a bunch of folk
                religion alongside Christianity, and when the elites
                actually decided for a change to pay any attention to
                how the other half lives, they freaked out. Actual
                witchcraft wasn't about Satan or Moloch or anyone the
                elites would have understood.

                Moloch is drab evil.

                For the most part, when the Catholic Church goes bad,
                it's fanciful elaborate evil. It's priests using the
                hope of heaven and the fear of hell to get away with
                sexually abusing children.

                (The Magdalen laundries would be an exception, where the
                Catholic Church teamed up with industrial slavery.)

                Moloch is order squelching the life (chaos and
                consciousness) out of people. It's one type of
                malevolence and possibly the most common type
                (efficiency adds power, up to a point), but not the only
                type.

                I don't know what you've been reading, Mathew, but the
                idea that "witches" were an actual religion -- "the old
                ways" -- was invented by Wiccans, of all things, in a
                rather hilarious attempt to gain legitimacy-by-age.

                Nobody takes it seriously. I'm actually surprised to
                hear there are still books available to buy claiming it,
                although I suppose I shouldn't be.

                Witch-hunting, (like werewolf-hunting and
                vampire-hunting) was primarily a lower-class pastime.
                The elites, with a few notable exceptions, tended to
                despair of their superstitious brethren. (Witch-hunting
                is, like other forms of superstition and mass panic, a
                human universal.)

            Nah, Christianity is a load of crap that tries to comfort
            people by saying that if they believe in Jesus they can have
            nice things in the afterlife, even while they deal with the
            sufferings of their real lives in, you know, their real
            lives.

            If we insist on keeping this "Moloch" character,
            Christianity mostly just apologizes for him and asks us to
            keep submitting to him.

                The difference between trying to immanentize the
                eschaton yourself, and trying to bring God into the
                world in a form self-correcting and free of original sin
                to do it instead.

                ... OK, there's probably no way to make this
                non-blasphemous in any normal Christianity, but in
                reality the difference is huge.

                What Nick said.

                Also, not necessarily. If MIRI is nearly as concerned
                with the subversion of human meaning and aesthetics to
                the infernal logic of "Moloch" as Scott obviously is,
                then they are not the NICE.

        As me, Oligopsony and maybe even Zizek would agree, the value of
        Christianity-as-Christianity (meaning actual Christ and
        sacrifice and all) should be investigated further insofar as we
        do reasonably suspect it to hold the key to acausal POWAH. I
        personally think it does.\
        The lesser Christian memes are just nice but certainly not
        domain-specific. They might've well be known as Islamic memes
        had history turned out slightly differently.

                Basically imagine some uplifting story about
                super-coordination in the name of emancipating the
                oppressed. Like
                [this.](http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2013/feb/04/lincoln-oscars-manchester-cotton-abraham){rel="nofollow"}

                > With the cotton industry on its knees, Lincoln
                > acknowledged the self-sacrifice of the 'working men of
                > Manchester' in a letter he sent them in 1863.
                > Lincoln's words -- later inscribed on the pedestal of
                > his statue that can still be found in Lincoln Square,
                > Manchester -- praised the workers for their selfless
                > act of "sublime Christian heroism, which has not been
                > surpassed in any age or in any country."

                Brings a (figurative) tear to my eye every time.

                Railroad.)

                that probably means "later this century" in practice.

                (And so I don't leave reasons to break my silence
                hanging around until Important Shit Got Done By Me,

    Reading this made me feel like my brain was just pressure washed. Ah
    well, pressing on!

    I've often heart Christian intellectuals say things like "God isn't
    some stern old codger up in the sky, God is the ontological basis of
    reality." It seemed.... plausible enough, in its own strange way.
    But before hearing your ideas on Moloch I never considered the
    possibility of "yes but what if the ontological basis of reality is
    a total jerk?"

    And also, hearing your description of that moment when you saw
    Moloch... made me immediately think of this [scene from
    Metropolis.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZpaWOLjWx0){rel="nofollow"}

    I had read Land's description of the "four horsemen of Gnon" before,
    and being the hopeless Romanticist that I am I immediately set to
    thinking of gods that could rival the four horsemen of Gnon--
    aspects of reality that are for the most part "on humanity's side".
    I could only come up with two:

    Prometheus --- Intelligibility\
    Not the fact that the universe follows laws, but the fact that those
    laws can be deciphered, and expressed in formulas and algorithms and
    trends. The fact that the universe is not a black box or total
    chaos, but something that can be comprehended by the human mind.

    Imhotep --- Artifice\
    The fact that things can be built. The fact that in small areas,
    entropy can temporarily be overcome. The fact that matter can be
    acted upon in ways that add order.

    I'm fairly certain someone could find a way to reframe Prometheus
    and Imhotep as aspects of Gnon though.....

        I have a suggestion for a third.

        Tyr -- Oathkeeping\
        The Norse god of law who gives an arm to bind the Fenris Wolf.
        The fact that people can make personal sacrifices where the
        benefits mostly accrue to other people. The fact that people
        express gratitude for this and track reputation. The power of
        making and keeping promises, encouraging people to do so,
        punishing traitors and in extreme cases even punishing traitors
        *who defect to your side*.

        (If you want to argue that the "reputation economy" is valuable
        enough that Tyr "isn't sacrificing" when he gives up his arm,
        then you can substitute this with "the power of the reputation
        economy to create decentralized coordination" or something
        similar. Binding the Fenris Wolf is still a big win!)

                Enki, creator of customs, could well end up as a neutral
                trickster, the kind who gets Tyr to enforce harmful
                contracts because "that's always the way it's always
                been."\
                Enki who tricked Tyr into banning women from driving.
                Enki who tricked Tyr into enforcing foot-binding or
                genital mutilation or stoning gay people to death
                because "that's what's in the rules."

    ::: comment-body
    Thank you for this. It is beautiful and awe-inspiring and reweaving
    the way I think about the world. (And so, in return for it, I will
    make you zeugmas and smile!)

    This post (and various other things that have happened to me lately)
    are leading me to rethink the oft-repeated contrast between nature
    and technology. For a very long time I've thought that all attempts
    at creating the singularity will either lead to [this sort of
    horror](http://kajsotala.fi/2012/10/technology-will-destroy-human-nature/){rel="nofollow"}
    (which resembles your post) or [this sort of
    horror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect){rel="nofollow"};
    that is, an AI that either destroys the world through an excess of
    chaos, or one that destroys the world through an excess of order.
    And I thought the best way to counteract these alternatives would be
    to simply stop building AIs, and let the laws of nature guide us
    instead. But now, thanks to your post, I understand that it's the
    laws of nature themselves that produce the AIs, when left to their
    own devices.

    And so this is an interesting refactoring of the perspective I'm
    accustomed to: not technology vs. nature, but Moloch vs.
    Coordination. But there's one thing I'm still not clear on (and
    apologies is this was addressed earlier in the comments, which I
    haven't read yet): coordination itself seems to be one of Nature's
    Gods. We started out with single-celled life, and those cells
    learned to coordinate with one another to make multicellular
    organisms. We started out with bacteria invading cells, but they
    learned to coordinate with one another and we got mitochondria. We
    started out with every man for himself, but we learned to coordinate
    with each other, and we got societies. Based on these examples,
    Coordination seems to be a very powerful God, who is perhaps at war
    with the other Gods you named. And so your post leads me to wonder:
    what are the conditions under which Coordination wins, and what are
    the conditions under which Moloch wins? (I assume they collaborate
    sometimes, e.g. in democracy and possibly capitalism, and in the
    evolutionary examples I just gave. Maybe Coordination wins when he
    aligns himself with Moloch?)

    Anyway, based on your post (and also the Universe basically walking
    up to me recently and saying "Darcey, you need to work on NLP for
    friendly AI"), I have found myself faced once again with this
    question:

    > Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire\
    > To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,\
    > Would not we shatter it to bits---and then\
    > Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!

    And I think I'm finally ready to answer it in the affirmative.

    Thanks again.

    (Edit: oh wait you addressed Coordination as a god by mentioning
    Elua, and tons of previous commenters have talked about Elua. So
    nevermind about most of this, although I would still like to
    understand why Elua triumphs, aside from "He just does." But can we
    please not portray Coordination as a god of niceness and happiness
    and flowers? Because that very narrow depiction of human values is
    part of what's terrified me so much about rhetoric of the FAI
    movement. See for example: wireheading, and the link I gave above to
    *Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect*.)

        See for example: wireheading, and the link I gave above to
        Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect.*

        Using *Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect* as an argument against
        the FAI rhetoric is a bit odd, given how a large part of the FAI
        rhetoric is explicitly saying that "FAI is important to get
        right, or otherwise we might end up with a MoPI scenario". The
        [original CEV
        proposal](https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf){rel="nofollow"}
        even explicitly mentions MoPI and *With Folded Hands* as
        illustrations of an FAI gone wrong, and Eliezer's written [one
        such
        illustration](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xu/failed_utopia_42/){rel="nofollow"}
        of his own.

        See also the [Fun Theory
        sequence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/){rel="nofollow"}
        and [Value is

            MOPI didn't sound too bad. It's hard to improve upon without
            lying to people, manipulating them, and/or changing them,
            like Friendship is Optimal, which does indeed give people
            fulfilled lives.

            I see *Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect* as a good example,
            because it shows that people can try really hard to make an
            FAI *and still get it really really wrong*. I mean, the AI
            in MoPI is pretty overly simplistic, but it's still a good
            demonstration of this general principle. So that's why I
            contrasted it with your post: your post shows AI run amok,
            without humans attempting to guide it into something
            reasonable; MoPI shows AI run amok, despite humans' attempts
            to guide it into something reasonable.

        If I really had any part in that decision, I am going to stick
        it right near the top of my achievements list. Good luck!

        Also, I think you and I might have different aesthetic
        associations with niceness and happiness and flowers (although
        you remain my favorite flower photographer). I'm not sure how to
        make the associations commensurable, except that you might want
        to try reading Lewis or Chesterton or Carey to get what I
        [called](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/16/can-atheists-appreciate-chesterton/){rel="nofollow"}
        a sense of active, terrifying Good.

        Elua is not Coordination; Coordination is merely one way we can
        hold off Moloch (along with surplus resources, physical
        limitations, and the fact that everyone hates Moloch, as
        mentioned in the post).

        As for where coordination comes from, consider your example of
        multicellular life. If single-celled organisms can be said to
        have a value, which they can't, it is dividing as much as
        possible so as to outcompete other such organisms. In joining
        together into a larger organism, they sacrifice this sole value
        and restrain their division so as to allow the whole to survive,
        thus gaining an edge over organisms which do not unite. Roughly
        the same process explains human societies.

        In other words, Coordination is born when Moloch eats itself.

    I feel the need to plug my [Technology will destroy human

    and about various physical limits that are currently stopping us
    from racing to the bottom but which technology will eventually
    overcome. (Sidenote: I've been thinking about expanding that post to
    a formal paper, but I'd need an evolutionary biologist as a

        I suspect you may be missing the point.

        How old are you? The current best estimate is still singularity
        at 2045, as far as I know.

        ("If that statement starts to chill you after a couple of
        moments' consideration, then don't be alarmed. A feeling of
        intense and crushing religious terror at the concept indicates
        only that you are still sane.")

            *Best* estimate? That's just Kurzweil. He doesn't even use
            the term "singularity" in the sense of localized, rapid
            intelligence explosion. [Eliezer's 2011
            estimates](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=12147){rel="nofollow"}
            said that he would be very surprised if AI hadn't been
            invented by 2111 and a little surprised if it hadn't been
            invented by 2061.

                What does "a little surprised" mean though? I sounds
                like assigning more than 50% probability to it being
                invented before 2061, which is not so far from Kurzweil.

    I cannot adequately express my appreciation for this post, so I'm
    going to leave it at "this is very good"

    Anyway, my first thought when reading this was actually "this sounds
    a lot like Evola" which means I might actually be able to add
    something, since I'm pretty sure most people here haven't read any
    more than (*at most*) Anisimov's cliffnotes version.

    In Evola's view ancient people weren't half as stupid as naive
    modernist interpretation of their stories would lead one to imagine,
    most of them were more like mnemonics (*look at the imagery of a
    typical memory palace; bizarre symbols are sticky ones*) for
    fundamental spiritual principles; or as the greeks would put it,
    principles of Reason. And as such their gods and demons weren't big
    oddly-colored people sitting around in unlikely locations casting
    spells, at least outside of the exoteric level which was usually
    reserved for the illiterate masses, but impersonal numinous forces
    which operated by somewhat-comprehensible rules and could thus be
    bargained with (*du ut des anyone?*) or even defeated.

    The big division in his perennial Tradition was between the
    Uranian/divine northern light and the Tellurian/demonic southern
    light. This isn't a good/evil distinction, because morality is
    personal and subjective and these are impersonal objective forces,
    so much as one between superhuman and subhuman striving; following
    the northern light leads the greatest men to embrace their divine
    nature, the southern light to embrace their animal nature.
    Transcendence versus subsistence, as illustrated by the difference
    between how the Pharaoh spoke to his gods before a ritual (*"O Gods,
    you are safe if I am safe / Your doubles are safe if my double is at
    the head of all living doubles / Everybody lives if I live"*) and
    how a Christian is supposed to ritually address his god (*"Father,
    hallowed be your name / Your kingdom come / Give us each day our
    daily bread / And forgive us our sins"*).

    And he was always very clear that it is in no way certain that the
    Transcendent force will win in the end, whether in the case of an
    individual or the cosmos.

    There are a lot of interesting aspects of this comparison, but the
    most immediate takeaway for me is Elua / CEV might not be your best
    bet on getting out of the coordination trap / age of destruction.
    Most of our urges, even (*especially*) the moral urges, will
    generally point towards the path of subsistence because after all
    that's why they evolved in the first place. To orient yourself
    towards transcendence you need a spiritual center which is capable
    of effecting change without being changed itself. In other words,
    I'm not sure we can beat the "dark gods" of materialistic
    competition without an esoteric God of spirituality to keep us on an
    even keel. Even 'secular' philosophies like Stoicism or
    Pythagoreanism had a lot more bite than most modern churches because
    of their esoteric character; between this and your post of
    ecclesiology it makes me wonder if you have fully appreciated the
    value of incorporating a spiritual / esoteric element into the
    Rationalist movement and/or society at large.

        This relates to something I've been thinking for a while, about
        how important it is for us to have ideals, particularly ones
        beyond "help other human beings" and "maximize human utility",
        which tend to be susceptible to wireheading given the mutability
        of human reward functions.

        It seems like human values typically fall victim to regression
        to the mean; before this post I conceived of this in terms of
        humans imitating one another. That is, most humans want to
        follow some sort of social standard, so they strive to be at
        least as moral as the average person. But a few people just
        don't care and behave immorally; they bring the average morality
        down. And so the rest of humanity, seeing their poor behavior,
        feels like they can be a little more lax in following the
        culture's moral standards. Iterate this process, and everything
        eventually degrades to complete immorality. This is why we can't
        just base our standards on what other humans are doing, but
        instead need to strive towards some fixed unmoving Ideal that
        cannot be corrupted by the activites of human society. (I assume
        Evola is writing about something similar to this? I've been
        meaning to read his books for ages, but haven't gotten around to
        it yet.)

            Pretty much, though going into Revolt Against the Modern
            Wolrd with a head fullof game theory will absolutely give
            you mental whiplash. His perspective is very difficult to
            coprehend from a modern perspective already so anything you
            can do to shorten the inferrential difference is good.

            One of the problems he illustrates is the fragmentation of
            the sciences, or more precisely their languages. An
            alchemist a mason a knight and a priest all spoke with the
            same symbolic alphabet which allowed them to see one another
            as part of one larger worldview and understand each others
            parts in it. Today we have a dozen different lenses which
            leave us with "seperate magisteria" or pointless conflict.

            I recommend using Marcus Aurelius's view of things; either
            there is providence or atoms, but either way certain truths
            hold.

            *It seems like human values typically fall victim to
            regression to the mean; before this post I conceived of this
            in terms of humans imitating one another. That is, most
            humans want to follow some sort of social standard, so they
            strive to be at least as moral as the average person. But a
            few people just don't care and behave immorally; they bring
            the average morality down. And so the rest of humanity,
            seeing their poor behavior, feels like they can be a little
            more lax in following the culture's moral standards. Iterate
            this process, and everything eventually degrades to complete
            immorality.*

            Conversely, morals have improved greatly in other ways over
            the past centuries and are still improving. A fixed ideal
            would not allow that, and this is problematic if the ideal
            chosen isn't the best of all possible ideals. I would claim
            as obvious that we are incredibly unlikely to pick that
            ideal initially.

    This is beautiful.

    The quote from Bostrom, about consciousness being outcompeted, is
    strongly, *strongly* reminiscent of Charles Stross's *Accelerando*:

    *"Early upload entrepreneurs forked repeatedly, discovered they
    could scale linearly to occupy processor capacity proportional to
    the mass of computronium available, and that computationally trivial
    tasks became tractable. They could also run faster, or slower, than
    real time. But they were still human, and unable to operate
    effectively outside human constraints. Take a human being and bolt
    on extensions that let them take full advantage of Economics 2.0,
    and you essentially break their narrative chain of consciousness,
    replacing it with a journal file of bid/request transactions between
    various agents; it's incredibly efficient and flexible, but it isn't
    a conscious human being in any recognizable sense of the word."*

    In the novel, the posthuman minds that are humanity's descendents
    --- the "Vile Offspring" --- utterly outcompete humans. (Their
    eventual actions are driven by value systems that we no longer
    understand, and that are thus sufficiently mysterious as to allow
    the author to decide that the Vile Offspring refrain from destroying
    us. We should not depend on having a similar narrative protection in
    real life.)

    I think this only gives you the short-term advantage, because now
    the Quiverfull movement is also selecting for retention and
    resistance to your memes. And it would be more accurate to say that
    80% of children who grow up in atheist families *don't exist* if the
    atheists are only having 20% as many children as the Quiverfull
    families. (your count is 25%, close enough.)

    This looks like a chance for me to exercise something resembling
    [post-cynicism](http://squid314.livejournal.com/353621.html){rel="nofollow"}:
    don't worry that the dishonest X-ists are doing so well, the Y-ists
    were dishonest too! Both sides of many of these "debates", in my
    impression, have been subjected to Moloch and tossed out their
    honesty in favor of finding ways to better coordinate one's side and
    lambast the other side and make plays for social status and attempt
    to use the machinery of government to ban the other side, and since
    my enemies are so terrible, maybe I can get some government funding
    to write about Why Those People Threaten Our National Sanity? I'm
    sure this is a very important use of your money.

    I expect I would agree with most of your *predictions* regarding how
    Land would *act*, but if asked to comment I think he'd disagree a
    little with this -- my impression is that he has figured out the
    principle and rejected it.

    I have more opinions, perhaps I will sort them into a post at More
    Right or something, because this is becoming a wall of text squished
    into the thin column of a comment space.

        Note Amish retention rates improved dramatically over the 20th
        century despite virtually no attempt to water it down to make it
        more attractive. Retention rates for new religious movements
        seem terrible in general but some combination of selection
        pressure, increasing sense of venerability, and differential
        breeding has made the Amish very much more successful than you
        would have expected in 1900.

            `q_c_defect_rate = 0.05`\
            `generations = 3`\
            and `defector_decay_factor` needs to be 0.4 for the
            Quiverfulls to outnumber the atheists within three
            generations. That seems pretty high: 60%. But there should
            be empirical data available for the Amish, so you could use
            that to figure out what to set the decay factor to.

            Would be more interesting to run it for the Amish (low rate
            of defection) than the Quiverfulls (high rate of defection).

            The future belongs to whoever shows up for it...

        I'm also interested in the extent to which you actually can
        outmeme a religion. We know that religious beliefs seem to be
        predicted by various personality and cognitive dispositions
        detectible in early childhood, even (I've done some posts on LW
        about some of that research); we know that religious beliefs and
        related dispositions are as heritable in the twin studies as
        anything else and so highly likely have some genetic base; we
        know personality traits likewise; there's some interesting
        speculation about subpopulations systematically differing in
        personality, which in the case of the Amish (
        [http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/inferring-an-aq/](http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/inferring-an-aq/){rel="nofollow ugc"}
        ) starts to look suspiciously genetic, and inasmuch as the Amish
        have exploded from \<1000 founders to somewhere upwards of a
        million last I checked and still growing fast, they clearly are
        *not* in a situation where all their excess growth is being bled
        off by memetic predation.

        So we have all the pieces for selection towards durability of
        religious subpopulations: genes to personality/cognition to
        religious inclination to specific religion to excess
        reproduction (and relative sterility of those bled off to the
        general population) to higher inclusive fitness to spreading in
        the population/gene pool.

            Maybe we need an atheist religion or two? Orientations or
            systems (as needed) that satisfy the urges that
            "religiosity" genes code for.

                Ok, Orwell is taking it too far towards his (kinky but
                not unusual) personal preference. Still, we must
                consider the *general* qualities of this aesthetic, and
                the lasting demand for them.

                Yeah, the song is from a science fiction universe I have
                slowly cooking, where a monarchic nation is born in a
                slave revolt. I'm not exactly a socialist, and neither
                is King Hank I (who adopts this version as his fledgling
                nation's anthem) but he came out of some really
                fucked-up hypercapitalist slavebreeding bullshit and
                built an aristocratic, capitalist nation dedicated to
                the pursuit of justice. I wanted to blend Reactionary
                and Progressive doctrines and got someplace very, very
                strange. The value of the aesthetic of struggle, danger,
                and death doesn't escape me, but it's kind of hard to
                stick in a technological culture designed to last in
                both peace and war.

                It's been done; what do you think Communism was?

                You could also claim Objectivism or
                [Nietzscheans](http://andromeda.wikia.com/wiki/Nietzschean){rel="nofollow"}.

        I was wondering this too....

        Perhaps it is of symbolic significance that the czars have
        become gods.

        This piece uses a god motif (Moloch, Gnon, Cthulhu, Azathoth,
        Mammon, Ares, Gods of the Copybook Headings, god's eye view,
        etc...). Changing "Czar" to "God" in order to fit that theme is
        hardly surprising.

        There's a real problem with the "give money to MIRI" thing,
        which is that the whole idea of Coherent Extrapolated Volition
        smacks of Moloch to me. If you look at the views of most people
        today and try to extrapolate from them, you get things like "the
        unbelievers must be killed or at least forcibly converted", "it
        is right to kill people who aren't in our group in order to
        defend the economic advantage of people who are", "people whose
        sexual practices differ from my own should be punished or,
        preferably, not exist", "people with autism should not exist",
        "women are inferior to men and should be subservient to them",
        "it is OK to torture those who are in the out group".\
        Those are the actual expressed values of the supermajority of
        people, I see no reason why a CEV would not implement them, and
        it is hard enough just living in a world where those values are
        shared by most human beings --- having a totalitarian omnipotent
        dictator with those values would be about the worst imaginable
        outcome as far as I can see, far worse than mere human
        extinction.

            Oh my god thank you for writing this comment, thank you so
            much, I have spent the last two years cringing in terror of
            the thought of CEV being used to design an FAI, because
            extrapolated values are going to look nothing like actual
            human values whatsoever; even if we took the so-called
            "nice" values, generalizing them is still a terrible idea.
            This comment only adds to my terror of CEV.

                Personally I don't think we have to worry. I've seen
                nothing from MIRI, ever, to suggest that they have the
                first idea how to build an AI, "friendly" or otherwise.
                If I thought there was even the slightest chance that
                they did, though, I'd be campaigning every second of
                every day to get them shut down as a danger to humanity,
                because CEV is such an obviously obscene idea.

                CEV basically is a "Cthulhu wins" button and seems
                obviously a bad idea -on a par with ensuring that
                Azathoth, Mammon, or Ares eats everything . This seems
                obvious to both Andrew and many nrx folks despite
                evident object level disagreements.

            That ... is not what CEV does.

            It's not some sort of global democracy, one idiot one vote.
            C**E**V *extrapolates* volition.

            Unless you think that the current state of affairs is a
            result of everyone having perfect information, the current
            state of affairs is probably not the place to start looking
            for CEV.

                CEV is meant to preserve human values. Most humans value
                things that are by my reckoning utterly abhorrent. They
                \*actually\* value those things, in a way that no amount
                of information can change --- people who find
                homosexuality disgusting, for example, are if anything
                likely to find it \*more\* disgusting the more they find
                out about it. The basic drive to persecute members of an
                out-group may well have a hardwired biological basis ---
                certainly it seems likely to me that it does.\
                Extrapolating that doesn't lead anywhere good.

                Those values are all perfectly coherent --- they can all
                exist together without any contradiction. And no matter
                how far you extrapolate from them, you'll never get
                anything good, or even neutral.\
                The whole argument behind CEV seems to be "it'll
                preserve those aspects of human values that Westerners
                who value post-Enlightenment thinking think worth
                preserving, while not preserving any of the icky ones we
                don't like because they'll be 'extrapolated' away,
                somehow". I think it far, far, more likely that it would
                lead to the opposite of that.\
                And I \*certainly\* see no reason to believe that
                anything that can "extrapolate" the human tendency to
                attack those who are different into peace, love, and
                tolerance for all people won't \*also\* "extrapolate",
                say, my desire not to be stabbed into a compulsion for
                everyone to stab me.\
                Either CEV would preserve current human values, in which
                case I should oppose it because current human values
                are, for the most part, evil; or it would destroy
                current human values, in which case I should oppose it
                because it would destroy things I value; or it would not
                do anything at all, in which case why build it at all?\
                The Yudkowskyite argument seems to be that it would
                somehow only preserve nice values and not nasty ones,
                but with no explanation as to how this would be --- and
                if there is some outside criterion for which values are
                nice and which are nasty, then that, rather than CEV,
                should be used from the start.\
                I would be unimaginably terrified of anything
                implementing CEV getting any kind of power, if I thought
                there was even the tiniest chance of it happening.

                I don't even think that extrapolating nice values will
                lead to anything good. I've heard the effective
                altruists give the following argument for helping people
                in Africa: if your neighbor down the street got hurt,
                you'd want to help him; similarly, if you knew the
                people in Africa, you'd have empathy for them too and
                want to help them; it's only coincidence that you've met
                your neighbor down the street but not the people in
                Africa; so you should extrapolate your desire to help
                your neighbor to the empathy you would feel for the guy
                in Africa, and help him.

                But this argument can be taken to an extreme, it seems,
                where you feel intense empathy for all forms of life,
                including individual bacteria. Where do you stop feeling
                empathy? In our society we see "all of humanity and no
                one else" as a clear Schelling point, but people in past
                societies have seen "only our race, and no one else" as
                an equally clear Schelling point. And maybe if we have
                more intelligence, we also have more capacity for
                empathy, which leads us to care a whole lot about every
                individual bacterium, which leads us to do crazy things,
                like wipe out all life on Earth because we can't satisfy
                all life's preferences simultaneously and we feel
                empathy for everything.

                I also think that if we try to make human values
                consistent, we will get something that looks absolutely
                nothing like normal human values, because normal human
                values are inconsistent. Considering that normal human
                values have kept society going for a few millenia now, I
                expect this to be a feature rather than a bug. Trying to
                make human values consistent with each other is part of
                [reason as a memetic immune
                disorder](http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/){rel="nofollow"}.

                Humans did not evolve rational morals that can be worked
                into a logical, consistent system. We evolved morals
                that assured our survival *in a specific environment*.
                Taking our values and letting them run wild, in a
                context very different from our ancestral environment,
                typically leads to disastrous results. Consider, for
                example, the human desire to eat a lot of fat and sugar.
                We don't have a restriction on that desire, because fat
                and sugar were pretty rare in the ancestral environment.
                But now that we have lots of fat and sugar, this evolved
                human value (assuming a "value" is anything that drives
                our actions) is running amok and wreaking all sorts of
                havoc.

                When I'm arguing against CEV I usually give the
                following example. Suppose you have a truck, and it's
                always going to be driving into a 50 degree wind, and
                you want that truck to go 50 miles an hour. So you
                program the truck to say "drive at 100 miles per hour",
                since that will achieve the goal. If the truck actually
                moved at 100 miles per hour, it would take turns too
                fast and crash. But the conditions of the environment
                assure that would never happen. But CEV would look
                inside the truck's programming, and say "ah, clearly
                this truck really wants to drive at 100 miles per hour,
                but its malicious environment is stopping it. So let's
                give the truck its wish." And then the truck actually
                drives at 100 miles per hour and crashes and dies.

                MugaSofer, thanks for the link; I just read it now. I'm
                not surprised Eliezer has also come up with this idea
                (and maybe I actually got the idea directly or
                indirectly from him, who knows). But the post makes no
                mention of CEV, so after reading it, I'm not clear on

                @ Andrew Hickey

                Not to be deliberately obtuse, but I can't see the flaw
                with CEV here. As far as I know, the point of CEV is to
                generate a compromise solution of morality which is
                acceptable/tolerable to all of humanity. As your views
                are in the minority, is it not expected that they will
                not be dominant within the AI implementing CEV's utility
                function? And that thus this is a feature, not a bug, of
                CEV.

                In essence, you appear to be using a progressive
                metavalue-set by which you judge other value-sets on
                their niceness which is just how close they are to your
                own progressive values. Then you argue that because a
                CEV using AI would not possess a value-set which is
                "nice" -- i.e. similar to your own -- the entire concept
                of CEV is flawed. However, the fact that you may find
                the values extrapolated via CEV abhorrent does not
                necessarily have any real bearing upon the correctness
                of CEV as a method. In fact, CEV may be the utility
                function for a FAI that maximises the utility of
                humanity in general after the singularity, even if you
                find its values to be morally wrong. I don't know
                whether this is actually true (and I suspect it isn't)
                but this line of argument seems to be fairly irrelevant
                as a criticism of the concept of CEV as the point of CEV
                is to find a solution for all, not just for liberal
                American programmers.

                PS: This is my first time commenting here, so I am sorry
                if this comes off in the wrong way or else betrays a
                fundamental misunderstanding of something really basic.

                The thing that makes me itch about CEV is the
                "extrapolated" part. I'm not convinced that even the FAI
                can know what you (or humanity in general) can know very
                much about what you would know if you knew more-- what
                you know has something to do with what experiences you
                have, not just your relationship to an existing body of
                knowledge.

                And your idea of what a better version of yourself would
                be is going to change according to what you've
                experienced.

                I can hope that people's CEV would include the
                opportunity to learn by direct interaction with the
                universe outside the FAI, and change as a result, but
                that doesn't seem to be the way it's described.

            I agree that CEV seems problematic for the reasons you
            mention, but it's also an old proposal which nobody
            considers anywhere close to complete, sufficient, or
            properly tested yet. If MIRI was saying that they were
            definitely going to use it as a blueprint for an AI, that
            would certainly be a reason to boycott them... but since
            they aren't saying anything like that, objecting to them on
            grounds of CEV seems like objecting to someone on the
            grounds that the first preliminary sketch at an idea that
            they came up with wasn't perfect.

                This raises my hopes for MIRI a little bit, but (1) a
                whole lot of people still talk about CEV, and I haven't
                seen MIRI do anything to disabuse them of this notion,
                and (2) CEV is such an obviously terrible idea that it's
                hard to trust anyone who came up with it to also
                generate good ideas in the future. (Not that I trust
                anyone to come up with good ideas; we're probably
                fucked.)

                More like "the first preliminary sketch at an idea that
                they came up with would destroy everything that is good
                and decent in the world because of incredibly obvious
                flaws that jump out within thirty seconds of thinking
                about it, but they chose to promote that idea in a
                thirty-eight page PDF paper which is still, ten years
                later, on their website, to not make any public progress
                from that idea in the ten years since, to repeatedly
                refer to it over that time period, and to make pro forma
                acknowledgements that yes, of course it's not perfect,
                while refusing to acknowledge any of the actual
                criticisms made of it".

                "If MIRI was saying that they were definitely going to
                use it as a blueprint for an AI, that would certainly be
                a reason to boycott them"\
                Well, at no point that I've seen have they ever said
                that they're \*not\* going to use it, or something
                similar, as a blueprint. Admittedly Muelhauser might
                have said something of the sort (I find his writing
                completely unreadable, so don't know what he's said),
                but I've read pretty much everything Yudkowsky's written
                (because even when he's wrong he's an extremely skilled
                writer) and he's never, that I recall, said anything
                other than that it's pretty close to the correct
                answer...

                The current working plan for FAI is [value

                / [value
                extrapolation](http://intelligence.org/files/IE-ME.pdf){rel="nofollow"},
                which are more general terms that don't make as many
                specific assumptions as CEV does. CEV continues to be
                mentioned and cited because it's the first proposed
                example of a value learning / extrapolation approach.

                As for CEV being an "obviously terrible" idea, I don't
                know: there are problems with it, but it still seems
                like a reasonable first stab at the problem to me.

                Take extrapolating desires: the opposite of this would
                be to do *no* extrapolation, and just go with the
                morality of current-day people. Well, in that case you
                get exactly what Andrew Hickey described in his original
                comment -- a totalitarian omnipotent dictator that
                punishes people for being different. Or actually you
                wouldn't, since in that regard there would be sufficient
                disagreement about the issue that the AI produced by CEV
                might choose to take no action about it -- meaning that
                all kinds of nasty behavior would be allowed to go on
                uninterrupted. That doesn't sound much better, either.

                Would extrapolating desires help? Well, there's the
                possibility that it wouldn't, but at least CEV contains
                the "if we knew more, thought faster, were more the
                people we wished we were, had grown up farther together"
                provisions on *how* the extrapolation is supposed to be
                done. There is an argument to be made for there having
                been a [long-term trend towards more peace and
                tolerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature){rel="nofollow"},
                fueled in part because of an understanding that other
                people aren't ultimately that different from us. Andrew
                suggests that things like wanting to persecute
                homosexuals are terminal values that do not change with
                more information, but we also know that the tendency to
                persecute others is associated with a psychological
                tendency to dehumanize them and see them as
                fundamentally different. It's plausible -- not certain,
                mind you, but plausible -- that the "knew more" and "had
                grown up farther together" provisions would end up
                making the dehumanization urge impossible, and thus
                eliminate most intolerance.

                Another problem with *not* extrapolating desires is
                that, as I alluded to earlier, it would essentially
                freeze moral growth and allow us to go on with all kinds
                of things that we might eventually come to consider
                moral atrocities. As specified, if CEV would realize
                that we'd eventually come to consider something a
                horrible mistake, it's supposed to nudge us out of that:
                "hey, you probably really don't want to do that".

                (CEV, p. 10)

                That said, the CEV document also explicitly mentions the
                possibility that despite all of this, the extrapolated
                desire of humanity would still end up creating a
                terrible world because most people were just that
                selfish. And it's specifically mentioned that if it
                starts looking like that's what will happen, then one
                should just scrap the initial "extrapolate from the
                desires of everyone" thing and try something else:

                (CEV, page 28)

                As for making human values consistent -- well, again
                there's the question of what the alternative would be.
                Yes, there's an extent to which human values can be said
                to be inconsistent, but most people also don't go around
                shooting people on even-numbered days and donating to
                pacifist organizations on odd-numbered days. (Actually,
                even that would be consistent, if it consistently obeyed
                the even-odd-day rule...) If human values really were
                inconsistent in a logical sense, that would mean that
                our behavior would be totally random, since inconsistent
                axioms allow you to derive any conclusion. But our
                behavior clearly isn't totally random, so there's still
                some consistency to our desires. When people say "our
                desires are inconsistent", I think in practice that
                mostly just means "our desires are so complex that I
                can't come up with a neat consistent formalization that
                would be simple enough for me to understand". But that
                doesn't mean that one wouldn't exist, even if it
                required a lot of weird special cases that weren't
                derivable from any axioms. As an existence proof, my
                brain already contains a consistent implementation of my
                values, since my behavior isn't totally random.

    "Any human with above room temperature IQ can design a utopia"

    I do believe this is showing your fahrenheit bias. Room temperature
    in Canada is \~ 23C, and a human with IQ23 may be a bit too stupid
    to dream. IQ73, on the other hand, is just above a moron
    (technically, original definition), so quite average.

    Reject the Imperialism! Join the free world, where units make sense!

    Note: I actually don't know what an IQ23 person would be like. It's
    5 standard deviations below the mean, which is to say, about 1 in
    800,000. So there's about 375 of these people in the United States.
    Are these people essentially walking vegetables, with minimal brain
    function, but still-functioning autonomic nervous systems?

        Comrade! In Fahrenheit, the temperature goes from a bit below
        zero to a bit above 100! In Celsius, the temperature goes from
        somewhere around -26 to somewhere around 41! Renounce your
        Jacobin insanity and return to units that make sense in the
        world!

        I don't think IQ would make sense at numbers as low as those.
        Doubt someone five standard deviations below the mean would be
        able to take an IQ test.

            Mmm, Fahrenheit works fine, until you're boiling water, or
            cooking generally, or doing science. A scale that goes from
            0 (water freezes at atmospheric temperature and pressure) to
            100 (water boils at ATP), and has degrees the same size as
            the Kelvin scale (builds nicely into a LOT of scientific
            formulae) just makes sense on a level that 32 degrees to two
            hundred and something degrees for liquid water and messy
            conversion factors in the equations really doesn't.

                Does Celsius-plus-Kelvin offer any advantages that
                Fahrenheit-plus-Rankine doesn't? (Other than that the
                rest of the world uses it. Is it built into the metric
                system somehow?)

                But at least Celsius doesn't run backwards

                    Yep, Kelvin/Celsius degrees are built into the SI
                    system; for instance I shuffled around degrees
                    Kelvin, Joules, Volts and Coulombs when I was
                    studying some electronics. Because it's built in,
                    you have fewer conversion factors and the maths is
                    simpler, meaning fewer errors.

                Celsius? Bah! Stick to straight Kelvins: works even
                better in the scientific formulas, and no negative
                numbers ever.

                (Fine print: Actually, negative temperatures can arise
                in obscure situations only tenuously related to our
                ordinary notion of temperature, and these cases make you
                realize that what you actually want to measure is not
                temperature at all, but coolness, in inverse kelvins, or
                even better in inverse units of energy. However, these
                matters are outside the scope of this comment.)

            Celsius only postdates Fahrenheit by two decades, but you
            make it sound like it's more like two centuries. (In
            particular, it predates the actual historical Jacobin Club
            by nearly half a century!)

    Outstanding.

    But what does Elua correspond to? Is it something you hope will
    exist in the future, or do you think there is now a force we can
    call our own?

        Elua is our desires.

        When the capitalist-god Mammon provides us with food, then it's
        because it cut a deal with Elua. When democratically-elected
        leaders don't abuse their powers because that would make them
        unelectable, that's Elua forcing ... Cthulu, I think ... to obey
        us.

            Which is why I think Elua is another trapper, not a
            gardener. Moloch may promise us power, but what is power but
            a means to satisfy our desires?

            Elua is the god of free love? But then we have to find some
            means of preventing conception, otherwise we rapidly run
            into the Malthus situation of "Al the women are getting
            pregnant all the time and families of ten or more are
            common" and we end up with Scott's island of artistic rats
            having a dozen children, who each have a dozen children and
            so forth until the rat-eat-rat society of competition and
            consumption evolves.

            Elua may have soft eyes, but he demands a price as well.
            Moloch asks us to sacrifice love for power. What does Elua
            ask us to sacrifice for love? Perhaps "Submit to me as the
            gardener". And even in Elua's universe, I suspect death
            still comes as the end.

            But that's not a selective force. That's where Gnon and his
            various emanations get their power from. It's how they can
            affect so much without any presence in the universe. I don't
            see any such force that cares about us or our desires.

                Well, you could argue that individual humans are
                exerting a selection pressure, by deliberately choosing
                things in line with their values.

                But yes, it's definitely the odd one out.

    That picture of the Luxor obelisk and its caption together represent
    the best instance of comic timing in a blog post I can remember ever
    seeing.

    Also, I really, really like your depiction of Elua, here and
    elsewhere. Now there is a god I can get behind. (Heh heh.)

    I think I'm going to have to read this a couple of times to get as
    much out of it as I can tell is there.

    It's quite pleasing to find that someone else agrees that upon
    discovering the existence of a god or equivalent being, immediate
    attempted deicide is the only reasonable course of action. That's a
    significant portion of my disagreement with religion; either they're
    wrong about the existence of God (and therefore need to change their
    minds), or they're right, in which case worship is the opposite of
    the correct response.

        But then Scott's Ultimate Gardener AI is the functional
        equivalent of a god, so we must destroy it -- which either
        leaves us back at the mercy of the jungle and the trap, or we
        have to create another entity to save us and establish the
        garden, which means a counter-god, which requires us to kill the
        new god, and so on and on.

            True. I realise I had in mind a slight caveat to that, which
            is that I don't apply it to godlike beings we have designed
            and built which are functioning for our benefit. Any
            preexisting deity or equivalent, which therefore is both
            more powerful than AND not subordinate to humanity, is a
            serious risk and requires extermination.

            I felt the same way about my parents a quarter century ago,
            and still feel that way about coordinated groups of people
            numbering greater than about six, so I acknowledge that this
            may not be the most mature approach to being outgunned.

    You say that the god of humans is the god of Love. But why shouldn't
    the god of humans also be the god of Hate? Why promote one emotion
    over its mirror image? Whence this symmetry-breaking?

    Everyone who studies human history and society -- like you and
    Ginsburg -- looks around in confused horror at all the violence and
    brutality and suffering. They typically conclude that human
    suffering is some kind of accident or mistake or coordination
    problem.

    Nope, sorry. Human suffering is caused by human hatred. Humans,
    almost without exception, accept as a terminal and transcendent
    value the destruction and oppression of other humans. The reason
    this fact is not widely known is just because of signalling problems
    -- people don't want to talk about hatred because it seems "icky",
    to use a Hansonian word.

    Don't believe me? Go back a few posts and reread the stuff about
    Arthur Chu. In particular, reread the comments by Chu himself. Now
    consider two theories:

    -- Chu is actually a good person, that is to say, one who desires to
    build a better world for everyone. His vitriolic hatred against
    rationalists/non-SJ types is fundamentally an EFFECT of a logical,
    consistent, objective philosophy and worldview that he developed
    from a blank slate starting place through an unemotional process of
    gradual conceptual accretion. He hates rationalist types because
    according to his philosophy, such people are the ones who cause
    human suffering (e.g. through racism and sexism).

    -- Chu is actually not such a good person (but not much worse than
    most people), because he is intrinsically motivated by hatred. His
    hatred is not the effect but the CAUSE of his philosophy and
    worldview. In Haidtian terms, Chu's elephant decided it was going to
    hate rationalists, and so his rider was given the task of finding a
    philosophy that could justify this hatred.

    In my view, hatred actually has two disastrous consequences. The
    first is the simple fact that hatred causes humans to hurt each
    other, or at least causes humans to fail to act ethically towards
    one another. That one seems inevitable, since hatred is a
    fundamental human emotion.

    The second is that hatred obscures our understanding of the world.
    Since hatred is such a difficult emotion to justify in a social
    setting, our conscious minds needs to perform all kinds of weird
    conceptual distortions in order to make ourselves look like
    reasonable, ethical people. These distortions cause all kinds of
    confusion and chaos in our sociopolitical system. The civil
    discourse is led systematically away from ideas that could actually
    help to improve society and towards ideas that hate-mongers have
    developed to justify hatred.

    (One good example of this is the idea that black underachievement is
    caused by white racism. Sure, white racism is bad, but the idea that
    it causes black underachievement is absurd on the face of it. And
    that widely held belief actually prevents our society from doing
    things that could help black people).

    We can't get rid of hatred, but we can at least acknowledge that we
    have a problem. Hatred should be accepted as an emotion like other
    emotions -- people shouldn't need to provide weird
    pseudointellectual explanations for feeling it. Why should this be
    so strange? We don't require the bride and groom to provide a
    philosophical justification of their love before getting married. We
    don't expect a mother to justify her love for her children through
    propositional deduction.

    If we normalize hatred as a legitimate emotion, we could at least
    have philosophical clarity. Modern Americans use dumb tribal
    political concepts to justify their hatred (the liberal vs.
    conservative split). We shouldn't have to do this. Coastal urban
    liberals should be able to say: we hate rural religious
    conservatives because they're in a different tribe (that's the real
    reason, after all). Then we could have a political discussion that
    isn't attached to tribal beliefs; people could weigh issues based on
    actual evidence and reason rather than how the issue aligns with
    their tribal membership status.

        It seems like there's an excluded middle here. Several,
        actually: Chu et al. might have accepted a superficially
        compelling worldview that turns out to have some nasty
        implications (such as hating rationalists for no good reason)
        downstream. Or the hatred and the worldview might basically have
        nothing to do with each other, and he just justifies one in
        terms of the other because humans. Rejecting "intrinsically
        motivated by hatred" doesn't bring us automatically to
        "perfectly just, rejoicing in justice alone".

        Most people aren't good or evil. They're good *and* evil.

            The huge excluded middle between "he's evil" and "he's good
            and logical" is pretty obviously "he's good and illogical".
            When someone brags about the fact that he's put on blinders
            and ear plugs to keep himself safe from mental infection by
            evil, you hardly need to call him evil to explain why he
            doesn't eventually realize what a mistake he's making as he
            flails around bumping into people. Those people in the way
            can be assumed to be evil, and if his defenses ever slip
            enough for him to see or hear anyone trying to inform him of
            exceptions, the very fact that they're not wearing blinders
            and ear plugs proves them to be enemies too!

                Agreed. And once you realize this, the really hard part
                begins -- how do you control someone who claims to be
                for everything you're for, yet is blind to the damage
                they cause? How can liberal progressives like me stop
                someone like Chu, preferably before he gets access to
                arms and followers and all the horrors that can be
                released once the "Well, why don't we kill them all?"
                option is on the table. And without handing victory to
                the oppressors that we *both agree* are bad bad people
                that shouldn't have power over us.

                If "someone like Chu" is just a blogger or pundit or
                reporter, then you just do what Scott's been doing: call
                him out on his nonsense. You have to be able to overcome
                the "but he's one of my tribe" impulse, which is hard,
                and once you've done that you ought to be ready to turn
                around again to forgive and forget if there's a change
                of heart, which is also hard. But mostly your only
                opponent is your own psychology.

                If "someone like Chu" is a politician in a partisan
                voting environment, then you're in real trouble, because
                if you go "circular firing squad" on someone from your
                own party then you sabotage yourself in the short term,
                whereas if you remain silent and allow your party to be
                identified with their mistakes and failures then you
                sabotage yourself in the long term. Here the psychology
                that's working against you is that of all the other
                voters, and I don't know how to fix the problem.

        I really got the impression Chu was inciting hatred in order to
        fulfill his own selfish desires for status etc.

        Selfish desires which, obviously, would be a lot more satisfied
        than they are now if people -- including Chu himself! -- hadn't
        gotten too close to a gigantic hate-machine and then
        deliberately fed it.

        Hence, co-ordination problems.

        \>You say that the god of humans is the god of Love. But why
        shouldn't the god of humans also be the god of Hate?

        The god of humans isn't "whatever the result of human actions
        is" -- that's covered by Mammon, Ares etc.

        Elua represents our preferences. We *prefer* there to be less
        hate in the world, and try to reduce it in our own hilariously
        feeble way whenever Moloch isn't busy increasing it. *That* is
        Elua.

        Your first two statements in theory one are, I believe, a
        perfectly accurate description of Chu's behavior.

        > His vitriolic hatred against rationalists/non-SJ types is
        > fundamentally an EFFECT of a logical, consistent, objective
        > philosophy and worldview that he developed from a blank slate
        > starting place through an unemotional process of gradual
        > conceptual accretion.

        Is there a single person in the world who derives their morality
        from a logical, consistent, objective philosophy and worldview
        from a blank state starting place through an unemotional process
        of gradual conceptual accretion? Seriously! Look at any person
        that people consider good-- MLK or Desmond Tutu or Norman
        Borlaug or Stanislav Petrov. Do you think that Stanislav Petrov
        didn't destroy the world because he had started with a blank
        state and logically and objectively and emotionlessly deduced
        that destroying the world would be contrary to Conclusion IIIb
        of argument 2a? No! Of course not. Morality *does not work that
        way*.

        The start of morality is emotion. It is "people are hurting, and
        that is bad, and I want to stop it." In Chu's case, people are
        hurting him and people he loved with racism and sexism and
        homophobia and transphobia. And sometimes you find that it is
        not just that people are hurting, it is that *someone is hurting
        them*.

        The emotion people usually feel when someone is deliberately
        hurting someone is righteous anger. And the thing is...
        righteous anger is *powerful*. Any successful social movement--
        from the Civil Rights Movement to the Tea Party-- runs on
        righteous anger. This very blog post is eliciting righteous
        anger against Moloch (that's why he's personified! So we don't
        go "huh, that's abstractly terrible," we go "I ENLIST IN ELUA'S
        FLOWER-COVERED ARMY"). There's a reason we punish people who
        hurt others. It's so they stop.

        So he is angry, and he is saying angry things at us. His anger
        is misdirected, I believe, but I do not believe that is the
        action of an evil person. I think it is the action of a person
        who cares deeply about others' suffering and who wants to
        protect them from those who hurt them. That is not evil. That is
        good, perverted. He is on the side of niceness and community and
        civilization, though he does not know it. And I hope someday he
        realizes that we and he are on the same team.

            If Chu was really only interested in helping his friends and
            building a better world, he should have found a better and
            more direct way of doing so.

            Let me give you an example of what I mean. The US wasted \$3
            trillion on the wars in the Middle East over the last
            decade. Anyone with an objective, dispassionate worldview
            and a proficiency with mathematics can see that this was a
            failure of colossal proportions, comparable to a crime
            against humanity. Chu's friends and allies were harmed
            profoundly by this failure. So if Chu really wanted to help
            his friends, he would direct his ire and vitriol against
            this kind of government SNAFU (and rationalists would be his
            natural allies in that conflict). But here's the catch --
            Chu's enemies were also harmed by the Iraq war disaster.
            Since such calamities don't change the relative standing of
            his tribe relative to the opposing tribe, he's not
            interested in preventing them.

            (Chu should also be getting less enraged over time, not
            more, since his side keeps winning political battles.
            Instead, he sees the fear in his opponents' eyes, and this
            fear inspires him to press his attack ever more viciously).

            So, sorry, I don't buy it. The dude is driven by hatred. But
            I won't call him "evil", though he is certainly capable of
            committing evil acts. And, again, I don't think he's much
            worse than everyone else.

    Even if Elua defeats Moloch, a greater Moloch is still out there.
    Assuming alien life exists, we degenerate into human-Elua vs
    alien-Elua, and Moloch is the referee for that battle.

    (That is, even if we defeat the Malthusian trap with coordination,
    our civilization is still in a meta-Malthusian trap with other
    civilizations.)

        This seems like an even starker case of "the competition is so

        If alien-Elua ...

        No, I'm sorry, I can't use that name. I hereby christen the
        predicted colonization-wave Galactus.

        Anyway, if Galactus existed, wouldn't we have noticed him
        devouring the galaxy by now? Where are the Dyson Spheres turning
        out the stars? Heck, why haven't we been visited by a Von
        Neumann Probe to reorganize our atoms, which Galactus could be
        using for other purposes?

        Why are we encountering an un-slain Moloch, if he's already
        dead?

                Thank you for that link -- it's quite an interesting
                short story. I doubt whether an actual conversation
                between superintelligences can be intelligible to a
                human, however.

    On terminology:

    GNON is Nature OR Nature's God, reversed. "Or" designating an
    agnostic routing-around of cosmological uncertainty. We don't know
    who's in charge, but whatever it is, it has some rules. Gnon is the
    embodiment of those rules.

    Further, Gnon is not "he". Gnon is a genderless abstract process.

    On enlightenment style drunken bravado (which you identify with
    transhumanism) and Hurlock's criticism:

    The problem with being really idealistic and saying we're going to
    win the universe is that it connotes certain things, like "LETS
    REARRANGE THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND ALL OUR SEXUAL AND CULTURAL
    NORMS AND ABOLISH WAR AND MAKE EVERYBODY NICE AND NOBODY IN CHARGE,
    RIGHT NAO!" which gets us all excited and overestimating our current
    power, which gives us the 20th century, which was rather nasty if
    you don't count the continued blessings of Mammon, and still isn't
    over.

    The ambition of the enlightenment \*was\* too naive. I mean, that is
    our ultimate goal in the end, but humans have a nasty habit of
    misinterpreting goals as means to achieve them.

    I favor, rather than enlightenment drunken bravado, a more
    aikido-esque approach. Rather than meeting Gnon head on full of fury
    and courage and getting smashed like the romans, carefully channel
    the horrible processes of Gnon in ways that increase our power and
    intelligence and coordination, and trip the usual horsemen into less
    damaging areas. Goal is the same, but I think connotation is really
    important. This is what I took from Hurlock's post.

    So why did I describe the goal locally rather than globally? First
    of all, we are already local. We can take at most a light-cone
    shaped slice of the universe starting in 50 years or so, and that
    can be terminated by intersection with someone else's cone at any
    time. But why narrower than that?

    As a strategic matter, if you want to build a garden, you don't
    bulldoze the whole amazon and start trying things and run out of
    funding before you can even plant anything and thus leave an ugly
    black-hole style clearcut, you start small. Make a proper garden in
    the immediate vicinity of your mansion. When that proves successful
    (after a few tries) you expand.

    If we capture Gnon locally, ambition will take care of the rest. If
    we try to go maximal up front, we get smashed like naive communists.

    Finally, as a pedantic matter, I think your conception of the telos
    of man is too soft. (likewse for all the others in your scene).

    Too much friendship and happiness. Not enough glory and pain. IMO,
    both are important, and there's plenty of room in the garden for
    both. The end of Ares should not be the end of War. Man is the
    war-ape and that's a heritage worth honoring insofar as it doesn't
    kill us.

        What, exactly, do you mean by this? That there should be wars,
        provided they don't kill us all? That there should be wars,
        provided they kill no one? That we should honor our warlike
        heritage by playing violent video games and watching Saving
        Private Ryan, but not fight real wars? That there shouldn't be
        wars, but there should be big marble monuments to famous
        warriors?

        Sorry if some of these interpretations seem uncharitable, but
        your phrasing lends itself to uncharitable interpretation.

            "Kill us" in the abstract.

            We want to achieve the dynamic where we collaborate with our
            brothers on a mortal campaign to figure out new and ever
            more glorious ways to kill the enemy and take their women,
            without getting into a dynamic where we are just pawns to
            Ares in its tendency to squeeze all the fun out of
            everything to optimize for the most competitive and
            flourishy forms.

            Whether souls are actually annihilated by this process is a
            separate matter. It could be done either way.

                Agreed, and I like war, probably more than is quite
                healthy, or even what is normal for an American male my
                age (26).\
                I have few objections to war per se, I'm no pacifist,
                but glorifcation of making others suffer, when there's
                no contract, no safeword, scares the hell out of me. And
                not in a way that tempts me to surrender to your armies.
                The kind of fear that makes me want to threaten you back
                -- don't start a war for the glory of Ares or you'll be
                sorry! And that impulse scares me too.\
                tldr -- I think if you glorify war as a glory-in-itself,
                rather than an extended tragedy where bits of glory or
                heroism can occur, there's something wrong with you.
                It's a very human thing, but it's one of the things I
                hope to eliminate if transhumanism becomes a real thing.

        I am applauding your last paragraph.

        That's one appeal of the concept of eternity, or of history. It
        allows the end state to be idyllic but glory is still expressed
        through the process that achieved the end state.

    Looking at religions worldwide and their history, I think it's
    pretty clear that this isn't the "heart" of religion.

    Rather, repeat-or-burn is a (... relatively) recent adaptation --
    one that pretty clearly proves your point about the incentives to
    optimize away our values.

    Compare "turn the other cheek" to the crusades. One is something we
    value. The other ...

    (Actually, arguably "turn the other cheek" formed part of a system
    that ... ah, this comment box is too small for my crazy theories on
    the grassroots tactics of the early church.)

            OK, let me put it this way: how many religions out there
            actually contain -- "at their heart" or otherwise --
            "Believe this statement and repeat it to everyone you hear
            or else you will be eternally tortured"?

            Christianity does, sure -- well, mainstream Christianity,
            anyway. Islam does. Various modern cults do.

            Judaism doesn't. Buddhism ... doesn't, unless you consider
            further reincarnations "torture", which I suppose you might
            since "life is suffering" is a notable tenet of Buddhism.
            Hinduism doesn't.

            Sikhs don't. I can't think of *any* Greco-Roman religion
            that says this. Bahá'í doesn't. Shinto doesn't. Jainism
            doesn't. Taoism doesn't.

            You may be sensing a pattern at this point.

            I think it's pretty clear that this particular tactic for
            spreading your chosen meme is, for whatever reason, a
            relatively modern idea. It worked OK for Christianity, got
            picked up by Islam, and ... that's pretty much it, actually.

                The cult of Elizer Yudkowski / MIRI does.

                Well, a simulation of you will get tortured.

                But it'll be a really good simulation because the AI is
                that smart!

                \@Steve --- Not only is that wrong with regard to *LW*
                consensus, it isn't even an accurate description of
                Roko's basilisk (which I assume you're alluding to) in
                the first place.

                The whole point of the censorship incident that led to
                all this ridiculous fucking drama was that Eliezer was
                trying to discourage people from thinking along those
                lines, because doing so makes anyone credulous enough to
                believe it (or, more charitably, inclined to take ideas
                seriously) miserable and doesn't substantially improve
                anyone's lives. Not common-sensically, not through
                exotic decision theory magic, not otherwise. This should
                be immediately obvious to anyone that doesn't stop at
                pattern-matching to naive Abrahamic tropes.

                I'm not saying it was a good call. It wasn't: Eliezer
                badly misjudged people's reactions, lost a valuable
                contributor to *LW*, Streisanded himself all to hell,
                and did serious damage to his own credibility and that
                of his organization. But the hypothesis that he was
                ham-handedly trying to ward off is not and has never
                been part of MIRI or *LW* thinking.

    Sports and Starcraft may be useful in this respect. After all, a
    perfect war is one where everyone is able to shake hands, grab a
    beverage, and be friends afterward.

        Maybe we can share a beer in Valhalla, but it's no fun if it's

            My idea was to have competition and adrenaline without the
            mass suffering and horror and insanity that often cannot be
            separated from war.\
            I think a marathon runner who gives up his place to help up
            a hurt competitor should be regarded as a moral equal with a
            soldier who commits some act of bravery.\
            The great thing about sports -- and this is what I love
            about the Olympics, even with all its horrible problems --
            is that people can beat each other and treat each other as
            honorable memories, and then share a beer or other beverage
            without the suffering and bullshit one would have to go
            through in order to get to Valhalla.\
            A friend of mine who plays women's rugby (full-contact) once
            explained why she loved it so much. I don't have it
            verbatim, but the gist was "I get to beat people up without
            getting arrested! And after the game's over, we get pizza
            with the other team, and it's the coolest thing to go over
            it with them and say things like 'you hit me really well
            there!\'"

                I call this gratuitously unkind. Get thee behind me,
                heretic.\
                It's certainly not a problem unique to Reactionaries --
                I've known enough bloodthirsty left-anarchists to ever
                think so.\
                And I'd say there's a number of Reactionaries who seem
                to quail from evil for its own sake -- Moldbug IIRC
                included much reaching and sacrificing and hemming and
                hawing when putting together his Royal California -- I
                remember Scott mocking him for it in the FAQ.

                *NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO*\
                Can we please NOT use this line of argument? It is a
                complete and utter failure of charity and a horrible
                strawman of NRx positions, as well as playing into the
                trope that progressives will distort NRx positions any
                chance we can.\
                We can be honest about our opponents, all it takes is a
                little bit of nuance. Peter, you are capable of this
                little subtlety, I know. Fluff, I'm not so sure.\
                Here's a (IMO) more accurate way of stating it:\
                Reactionaries prize order and the maintenance of order.
                In my view, those Reactionaries that place high value on
                war prize its qualities of "keeping outsiders at bay"
                and "masculine strength and aggression," and ignore
                rather than revel in the suffering and horror it causes.
                Note the Reactionary talking point that wars in the past
                were more "honorable" and "chivalrous" and did little
                harm to civilians, even though this point is flattened
                by the Thirty Years War, the Hundred Years War, the
                constant hammering of sword on shield during the Middle
                Ages, the Crusades...\
                Nyan's prizing of Ares is *concealing* rather than
                reveling in suffering and bloodshed. It's a glorious
                Manichean struggle where Right and Order win out over
                Chaos.\
                Nyan, who's got the more accurate portrayal of your
                position: myself or fluff/peter?

                Is that the best steelman for "war is good" that you can
                come up with?

                Hint: competition, incentive structures.\
                Another hint: the Z3. For which institution was the
                computer invented?

                (The part of the Cold War that didn't involve proxy wars
                was a good substitute for war in this view. But not in
                the masculine strength view.)

                There was a theory --- I forget where I saw it, maybe at
                Xenosystems --- that said that the reason Europe
                industrialized and China didn't is that China was one
                big state fighting off barbarians, whereas Europe was a
                bunch of small states at around the same level fighting
                among themselves.

                The idea that Europe eventually did better than China
                because Europe was divided by geography and had
                competing states shows up in Jared Diamond.

                The fact that China was doing better (or at least had a
                more complex civilization) for quite a while suggests
                that the right size for a culture might be contextual.

                Are you insane? This was the war that, as it's primary
                tactic, involved building weapons capable of *killing
                everyone* and deliberately wiring them so that -- if one
                were ever fired, perhaps because a computer glitch
                informed them we had fired one at them -- *every nuke on
                the planet* would go off.

                The Cold War was Moloch's attempt to wipe us out before
                we became troublesome, and it almost succeeded.

    "I continue to think it obvious that robots will push humans out of
    work or at least drive down wages"

    Yes, this debate is over.

    Gregory Clark: "After all, there was a type of employee at the
    beginning of the Industrial Revolution whose job and livelihood
    largely vanished in the early twentieth century. This was the
    horse... There was always a wage at which all these horses could
    have remained employed. But that wage was so low that it did not pay
    for their feed, and it certainly did not pay enough to breed fresh
    generations of horses to replace them. Horses were thus an early
    casualty of industrialization."

    Humans are more adaptable than machines, so mostly continue to be
    employed, though already some are permanently unemployed. As soon as
    machines are more adaptable than humans, humans will be permanently
    out of work.

        I don't think anyone with a clue disputes that this is the
        endgame, barring an intelligence explosion or some other
        monumental change to the human condition. Most arguments are
        about how long it will take, and to what degree it has already
        happened. See [Eliezer's

    It seems that Moloch is one face of Azathoth: selection by survival.
    There is another face: selection by sex. Peacock tails and baboon
    bottoms; music and collected philistine foreskins; chivalry and
    pick-up artistry.... This face has power outside the biological
    realm: much of college education may fall under its purview. I
    nominate Ishtar as a name, ancient goddess of lust and war but not
    of love. Ishtar is not a friendly goddess, not in a Yudkowskian
    sense, but she seems a little better for us than Moloch.

    One missing thing is the ability of an individual human to stand up
    to these elder gods. This is something technology enhances. Norman
    Borlaug punched Moloch in the gut so hard it hasn't recovered. It
    will. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another
    shape and grows again. But if we can produces Borlaugs every century
    or so, we can keep starvation at bay. A few centuries ago, there
    could be no Borlaug. The balance does seem to be tilting in our
    favour there.

        There are fundamental physical limits. Producing a Borlaug every
        century will just mean continuing exponential growth until we
        eat through all the energy/negentropy/matter/space/whatever in
        our universe.

    Am I the only one who kept seeing gaping hole after gaping hole in
    the "real-world" examples? I feel like it was all summed up by "For
    a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as the ideal
    case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other
    things to see the underlying mechanism."

    In other words, these weren't real-world examples, they were thought
    experiments, and usually thought experiments that missed a \*lot\*.
    The effect was of reading Aristotle declaring that heavier things
    fall faster, because it made sense in his head, and he didn't
    actually try it out.

    In brief:

    2\. A strange game, the dollar auction. The only winning move is not
    to play, which is why people don't. Instead, they tend to go to
    normal auctions with normal rules. You started by assuming a god-eye
    central planner forcing the people into a game with bad rules.

    3\. Another resolution: The Aquaponics folks learn about this lake
    fill of awesome nutrients, so they set up shop and turn all of that
    fish waste into vegetables.

    4\. Why have a thought experiment about rat island? We have lots of
    actual, real islands, full of organisms, every one of which should
    be subject to your Malthusian traps. Do island ecosystems actually
    run through constant boom/bust cycles? Did native Hawaiians revert
    to primitive savages, devoid of any art due to the hopeless
    competition for resources?

    5\. There's a huge, enormous, gaping hole here: you forgot that the
    companies also compete with each other for workers. This is a
    counter-pressure to the pressure to sell at the lowest possible
    price, and only one of many.

    As it is, the thought experiment is equivalent to one where you
    declare that in a cutthroat industry all prices will reduce to
    \$0.01, because everybody wants to undercut everybody else, and you
    forgot to account for the fact that it still costs money to make the
    thing.

        I suppose it depends on whether infanticide to keep up per
        capita wealth counts as metaphorically sacrificing children to
        Moloch... oh wait.

        Maybe you'd rather discuss the well-known artwork and technology
        of non-Polynesian islands like Tasmania? Oh wait.

            Terrible? Perhaps (I'm not convinced that infanticide is so
            much worse than abortion). But definitely not Malthusian. I
            wouldn't want to live in historic Hawaii, but they were not
            locked in an endless struggle, barely subsisting with no
            room for entertainment because it would decrease their
            ability to compete.

            Rather than claiming that malthusian societies do not exist
            I would make a weaker claim that limited resources plus
            competition do not inevitably lead to a Malthusian scenario.
            Having said that, I'd be interested to hear of an actual
            malthusian scenario in humans.

        Now that really \*is\* fighting the hypothetical. What if you
        replace the "filters" with overfishing?

        Not every cloud is made of silver linings, you know.

        Just because you can imagine the pollution having useful
        side-effects, doesn't negate the fact that *they didn't use the
        filters* -- when they all believed it would screw them over.

        Well, it \*would\* be a gaping hole if Scott hadn't spent so
        much time talking about exactly how that impacts the situation.

            But the challenge is that the entire idea of Malthusian
            doomsday scenarios is based on hypotheticals rather than
            reality.

                Exactly. It's very important to remember that Malthus
                was *wrong*. The Population Bomb was *wrong*. And they
                were not merely wrong, they were genocidally wrong. If
                we had followed their advice, we would be far worse off,
                with fewer people living crappier, oppressed lives.

                So if you find yourself proclaiming the Gospel according
                to Malthus, we should probably assume that you're wrong,
                too, especially when all you've got are the same thought
                experiments that misled him.

                I'm sure that such scenarios are possible and have
                happened, but they seem neither common nor inevitable;
                if they were, we wouldn't exist in the first place.

                Most of human history was Malthusian. The facts we was
                seeking to explain was that technological improvement
                throughout history allowed for differences in population
                density but did not sustainably improve standard of
                living because more resources were inevitably used on
                more people rather than improving existing lives.

                It's an exaggeration to say simply that he was "wrong,"
                and just leave it at that. He was right for the entirety
                of civilization's history up to 1820, when the
                industrial revolution fully kicked off (ie, sustained
                exponential economic growth). He first published in
                1798.

                Which societies in history were Malthusian? With no
                entertainment, art or leisure and with all resources
                devoted to either reproduction or survival? I admit I
                don't know much about non-Western history, but I don't
                think Malthusian societies were common or even a
                majority.

                One of the reasons why Malthus was wrong is that trading
                off all values for short term reproduction and survival
                is not always an optimal strategy. If it were then only
                micro-organisms would exist. It is a poor strategy for
                the same reason that gradient descent is a poor
                optimization algorithm.

                I, too, would like some backup for this claim. What were
                the Malthusian societies?

                But I'm still going to say he was "wrong," because he
                was, and dangerously so. Aristotle was right for the
                entirety of civilization's history when he declared the
                Heavens immutable and the earth at the center, but we
                don't hesitate to call him wrong, and his error didn't
                involve calls for concentration camps.

                "hypotheticals rather than reality."

                And overfishing is *real*, as are sweatshops -- no?

                ETA:

                "It's very important to remember that Malthus was wrong.
                The Population Bomb was wrong."\
                This is absolutely true. Some people here seem to be
                using "Malthusian" to refer to Hansonian hardscrabble
                frontiers -- that is, situations where resources are the
                limiting factor on production -- and not to anything the
                historical Malthus ever actually said or thought.

            But my ability to fight the hypothetical at that level is
            indicative of how flawed the conclusion is. All of these
            were purporting to show cases where the solution is
            oh-so-obvious at a high level, but individuals can't get
            there, thus it's all a coordination problem.

            But the solutions are usually not obvious. The people who
            think they have god's-eye-views don't actually have
            god-eyes, they have puny human tunnel vision. Where Scott
            sees coordination problems, I see lack of innovation.

            The central planner of the fish farms would have destroyed
            \$300,000 pulling out fish waste (and then polluting some
            other place with it). A pack of clever entrepreneur
            aquaponics would have saved all that money, added more on
            top of it, and given us a balanced diet to boot.

            The solutions are not obvious, and we don't have a planner
            wise enough to find them. Our problem isn't coordination,
            it's that we don't even know what we should be coordingating
            around. Our best method is still having a lot of people
            throw a lot against the wall and seeing what sticks

        #3 is based pretty closely on actual observed behaviors. The
        original "Tragedy of the Commons" was an explanation of the
        observed tendency of communal pasture lands to be overgrazed.

        The standard libertarian solution is to "enclose the commons"
        --- convert the shared resource into private property, with an
        owner who has authority to set rules for its use and exclude
        anyone who refuses to abide by them. This is also based on
        real-world observations of what happened when England passed the
        Enclosure Acts and converted communal pastures into private
        property.

            Oh, I know that it was a variant of the Tragedy of the
            Commons, but the thing about the Tragedy of the Commons is
            that we know how to fix it: privatize the Commons, so that
            users experience both the down and up sides of their
            actions. Less collectivism works better than more
            collectivism in this case.

            (Yes, I know there are still cases where the Commons rears
            its head, like with species of fish that are both tasty and
            require hundreds of miles of ocean and stream to complete
            their life cycle, but once you need to stretch the
            hypothetical to that extent, it should be clear that you're
            dealing with an edge case which is not a good guide towards
            general policy.)

                OR, we could treat Enclosure as a result of poor
                co-ordination and a sub-optimal result, bring back the
                idea of public goods and the common weal, and
                nationalise/municipalise/etc the shit out of things so

                You could, if you don't like innovation and progress.
                Like I keep saying, the primary problem isn't getting
                people to do what works best, it's that we don't even
                know what works best.

                I'd agree that many of your examples are related to (or
                examples of) the Tragedy of the Commons. You sell it
                short when you say that privatization is the only TofC
                solution, perhaps because you've been reading too many
                economists and libertarians. 🙂 The original Tragedy of
                the Commons paper had a much broader solution than that,
                which it stated as "mutual coercion, mutually agreed
                upon". Privatization is only one such system of mutual
                coercion. Access to TofC resources can be limited by
                price and privatization, sure, but they can also be
                limited by waiting lists, by need, by random lottery, by
                tests of strength, by social status, by tradition, by
                divine revelation, by production planning boards, etc.

    That was fantastically terrifying.

    It seems though that there is a very simple way to fight Moloch.
    Given an excess of resources, competition will not lead to negative
    sum gains. This can be achieved by finding new frontiers either
    physically (look to the stars) or technologically.

    But there is a darker way to ensure that there will always be an
    excess of resources. You could establish a league hidden in the
    shadows who understands why civilization must never run at full
    capacity. A league dedicated to periodically destroying parts of
    civilization so that there will never be a Malthusian scenario.

        Physical expansion of resources doesn't work forever: Light
        speed lets us acquire c_1\*t\^3 resources, but we need
        c_2\*(1+r)\^t to satisfy an exponentially reproducing
        population.

        Technological expansion of resources doesn't work forever:
        eventually we hit max negentropy, or available mass, or whatever
        the limiting resource turns out to be, and we're at c_3.

        (plug in reasonable guesses for r and c_i and you'll find that
        "forever" can be strengthened to "for more than a couple more
        millennia" in each case)

        So although "an excess of resources" has been a fantastic answer
        to Malthus so far, in the far future (barring \*scientific\*
        expansion; maybe thermodynamics will have cheat codes so we can
        create new universes or otherwise answer The Last Question?)
        we'll need something better.

    **Warning:** really depressing thought ahead.

    Could this just be anthropic bias? When Elua doesn't get lucky, we

    Scott, this is probably the best and most terrifying thing you have
    ever written.

    Honestly, I don't see your hope. Any 'Elua' AI meant to optimize for
    human happiness/peace/security etc. would be advanced enough to
    reconsider its own motivations, and go who knows where.

        Have you read Eliezer Yudkowsky's [*The
        Sequences*](http://lesswrong.com/lw/72m/an_epub_of_eliezers_blog_posts/){rel="nofollow"}?
        They are very similar in style to Scott's posts, and they
        explain why you are wrong about this.

    6 kind of tickled me. The implication is that women's lib was a
    Malthusian evil, and the traditionalists were taking the rational,
    god's-eye view (interestingly, they would make that literal claim).

    It also points out what's missing in the claim "absent a government
    literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn't get one
    will be left behind." You don't need a government proclamation;
    religion handled this quite well for centuries, if not millenniums.

        The traditionalist *ideology* claims to be the lesser evil, but
        alas, as many social historians would tell us, patriarchal
        "social technology" functioned in a decidedly Molochean way. It
        might pass as "technology" for those at the top, a
        life-shattering terror for those fed into the lowest levels of
        the machine -- like those unwed mothers, or the female slaves,
        or the harassed maidservants...

        A quotable bit of *The Poverty of Philosophy*, often used by
        novice Marxists even nowdays, is:

        > "Economists have a singular method of procedure. There are
        > only two kinds of institutions for them, artificial and
        > natural. The institutions of feudalism are artificial
        > institutions, those of the bourgeoisie are natural
        > institutions. In this, they resemble the theologians, who
        > likewise establish two kinds of religion. Every religion which
        > is not theirs is an invention of men, while their own is an
        > emanation from God."

        I'd invert it for the smarter neoreactionaries:

        > "Reactionaries have a singular method of procedure. There are
        > only two kinds of institutions for them, Cthulhic and
        > rational. The institutions of progressivism are Cthulhic
        > institutions, the traditional ones are rational institutions.
        > In this, they resemble certain creationists\[1\], who likewise
        > establish two kinds of genesis. Every species which is not
        > theirs is an product of evolution, while their own is created
        > in God's image."

        \[1\] Anyone willing to come up with a wittier parallel, please
        do! The obvious crowd-pleaser here would be the racialist trope
        of "liberal creationism", but I find it rather disagreeable, so
        I am a bit at a loss.

        (Originally I wanted to write a longer rant at Athrelon for one
        of his previous comments which downplayed the gaping
        Malthusianisms of 19th century British patriarchal customs,
        criticizing the disconnect between "Social technology"/cozy
        reactionary stuff and "Cthulhic drift"/chaotic progressive
        stuff. This is much in the same vein.)

            Why, the example you seek is the hated *liberals*, of
            course.

            They believe every society but theirs is a result of their
            forefather's stupidity; while theirs alone was a result of
            observing the facts.

            (Other examples: 9/11 truthers, religions, Marx himself.)

                I think today's smarter American liberals do already
                feel too weak to feel like society is *really* theirs. I
                might be too optimistic, but I dare say that some
                utterly delusional hopes did get crushed during the
                Obama administration.

    "I assure you, they are not willfully disagreeing with you because
    they secretly know all your arguments are correct, but deep down
    they want bad things to happen."

    That is, in fact, my entire point. People who disagree with me \*on
    basic values\* do so because... they value different things. That's
    kind of what a disagreement about basic values means. It's not that
    they "secretly know all my arguments are correct", it's that two
    people can have two different sets of terminal and instrumental
    goals. Two people with different goals will, if presented with the
    same facts and the same arguments, still come to different
    conclusions as to what is a desirable course of action.\
    As an example, there are people for whom their children are the
    highest, most important, value. If you tell them "if you take this
    action it will shorten your life by ten years, but your children
    will get an extra twenty years of life, during which time they will
    be happy and fulfilled", they would take that action. I, someone who
    doesn't want any children, would not take the action, and neither of
    us would be able to persuade the other to do so by rational argument
    or facts alone.\
    And in my experience there are many people, perhaps the
    supermajority, for whom hatred of the different is a terminal value
    in exactly the same way as love of their family.

    The worst part of this article is that nobody I know will get it
    when I send them a link followed by *go read this right now*.

    > From a god's-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second
    > job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone
    > will get exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have
    > to work one job.

    In the interest of nitpicking, does this really hold? Unless that
    second job is producing nothing of any consequence, house-niceness
    may be stable but the effort spent earning the money for it is
    increasing the supply of something, somewhere.

    In following that thought, I have another thought congealing that
    much of human labor is spent on things that are both useless and
    unpleasant, and the driver for this is the necessity of
    participating in zero- or close-to-zero-sum competitions using the
    wages thereof. So that second job could very well be entirely
    disposable, after all.

    ETA: Maybe more relevant to the post: I actually like the way you
    insert mysticism and metaphor into your work; it tickles parts of my
    brain that I usually refuse to engage outside of fiction. I \*like\*
    mysticism, I \*enjoy\* it, but there aren't many real-world outlets
    for it that aren't stupid, wrong, or both.

        I'm not quite convinced, but there is an argument that most of
        the growth in per-capita employment indeed produces nothing of
        any consequence.

        Whether or not you buy this probably depends on your opinion of
        admin work, and of the parts of government it interfaces with.

        No, the women working produce value, the argument is that they
        don't produce any more value than they would have if they were
        not working (for cash).

    So the memetic race to the bottom has nothing to do with Leftist
    groups all around the world pushing for open borders, gay marriage
    and people losing their jobs for using the wrong pronoun to refer to
    transexuals. The real problem is Quiverfull having white babies and
    polluting the environment.

    And we need Coordination, i.e. world government to save the world
    from efficient robotized business and Quiverfull breeders.

    You can put that as an abstract for your busier readers.

            To be fair, those ARE the emotionally salient points --
            i.e., the points attacking cherished beliefs -- for a
            certain kind of reader. And emotional salience has a way of
            raising certain parts into relief and fading certain parts
            into background noise; that's sort of its whole *thing*.

        Yes, pretty much. But don't forget the TERFs and Arthur Chu.\
        But seriously, span, want a stake for that strawman?

                I think it's a strawman, but I do agree with the
                non-strawman form of it.\
                Spandrell said:

                > So the memetic race to the bottom has nothing to do

                I think this is sarcasm containing a strawman. I don't
                think Leftist groups agree on open borders or people
                losing their jobs for referring ot people with the wrong
                pronoun. Gay marriage may be a bit more universal among
                us leftists, but there isn't much of a coherent argument
                against it that doesn't boil down to "ew ick!"\
                But I agree to a point with the strawman -- less-fringy
                forms of zealot Christianity (like the mainstream of the
                Rick Santorum-Mike Huckabee-Pat Robertson form) are
                indeed a problem, as are irresponsible corporations. But
                so are Arthur Chu and TERFs and intolerant,
                irresponsible leftists, the kind who think someone can't
                be a positive influence in society if they're a
                Christian at all.\
                Niceness is *hard*, and civilization is *hard*, and it's
                not surprising that leftists fail as much as rightists
                do. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't at least *try* to
                build a nice civilized society and beyond in a leftist
                way.

                Well, there's the precautionary argument: the one that
                says "thou shalt not fuck with stable institutions
                unless thou knowest exactly what thou dost". But that's
                less an argument against gay marriage and more a fully
                general argument against social changes, even if it's
                applied rather selectively by mainline conservatives.

                (Statement of conflicting interest: I'm for gay
                marriage.)

                The god who handed down the *me*s to the cities also got
                humans to grow their food in his semen. Enki is a
                trickster, and he is smarter than you.

            Are you an American? (Or British, etc.).\
            They don't so much push for open borders legislation, as
            refuse to enforce actual immigration restrictions. Because
            politics.

            Or, are you drawing a distinction between some intellectual
            left and the left-leaning people with actual power?

                They think it's impractical and inhumane to deport
                existing illegal immigrants, but when you talk about
                letting significantly more immigrants come legally, they
                object strenuously. Leftists are largely
                [territorialists](http://openborders.info/territorialism/){rel="nofollow"},
                not open borders advocates.

        While I admire the nrx appreciation of memetic races to the
        bottom, I find their particular examples incomprehensible.

        Like, okay, let's take gay marriage. "In sufficiently intense
        competition to optimize for x, all values other than x will be
        thrown under the bus".

        What X is gay marriage optimizing? If you say "holiness", why is
        supporting gay marriage the holiness-signaling thing, but
        opposing gay marriage (like it says in the Bible, the Koran,
        etc) less effectively holiness-signaling?

        What useful value is being thrown under the bus?

        Remember, one of the *main* determinants of memetic fitness is
        truth-value -- that we now believe in heliocentrism isn't
        because a memetic race to the bottom destroyed our value of
        geocentrism, it's because people thought about it harder.

        It's hard for me to see your theory as able to distinguish
        between memetic races to the bottom optimizing for 'morality' --
        and real morality which we ought to preserve and celebrate, if
        indeed you even believe the latter exists.

            If I may sorta-steelman this question a bit, supporting gay
            marriage is signalling "EQUALITY!" and "RIGHTS!" while
            throwing heteronormativity and patriarchy under the bus.
            Can't let people doubt the Bible the foundation of our
            culture, can't let people doubt Leviticus or they'll start
            killing and enslaving and raping all over the place!

            NRx is actually stealth moral realism, which posits
            attractors in idea-space towards which the smartest and most
            compassionate people will race the fastest, and then
            identifies it as its enemy -- a necromancer feverishly
            casting *Detect Good* on his palatanical opponents. Hence
            the monotonous edginess of the aesthetics -- "Sith Lords,"
            "Dark Enlightenment," Nydwracu's black and white magic,
            "holiness," &c.

                Yes, although I find the "Sith" bit kind of funny,
                especially from Moldbug; there was that KOTOR-like
                Bioware game, Jade Empire, which used the SW Force
                alignment as it is in the Extended Universe (and in
                SWTOR), and rehashed it as "Open Palm" vs "Closed Fist";
                well, it was a somewhat better depiction of the Force
                than in the movies or in KOTOR -- Nietzschean antiheroes
                vs. creepy reactionary Buddhists (ultimately including
                the main villain). When the "Sith" aesthetic is not
                about killing puppies, but updated to its Extended
                Universe state, well:

                > Peace is a lie, there is only passion.\
                > Through passion, I gain strength.\
                > Through strength, I gain power.\
                > Through power, I gain victory.\
                > Through victory, my chains are broken.\
                > The Force shall free me.

                "Who would say holiness?"

                A neoreactionary who claims liberalism is a stealth
                religion?

                That's my guess, but its an odd thing to say.

                I'm no neoreactionary, but I think the concept of sacred
                values has legs outside of the realm of explicit
                religion. Holiness in this context then becomes a
                relatively straightforward extrapolation for adherence
                to those sacred values.

                Contra Scott, though, I don't think that supporting gay
                marriage is *reliably* the holiness-signaling thing
                here. I instead think we're dealing with a collision
                between sacred values. Opponents of gay marriage might
                be less willing to adopt the trappings of holiness in
                places like San Francisco, but that's because they're
                running a pariah belief system by the standards of the
                region. Drive two hours east and you'll start seeing
                different behavior.

            "What useful value is being thrown under the bus?"

            Being able to see what's in front of you.\

            Seems a pretty useful value to me; yet acting on it deprives
            of you of your livelihood.

            And of course it's equality and however the progressive
            elite interprets that which is officially holy. Where have
            you been the last 200 years?

            You gotta write less and read some Jim Kalb for a while.

            And who the hell said memetic fitness depends on truth?
            Surely Islam didn't get this far for its accurate astronomic
            analysis. Geocentrism could be reinstated quite fast if you
            put it in children textbooks.

                Nobody said that memetic fitness "depends upon" truth as
                a necessary condition. Scott's claim was that truth is,
                *ceteris paribus*, fitness enhancing. It's possible to
                deny that claim, but I'm not sure at any price less than
                Pyrrhonian skepticism.

        My radical position is that our society's position on LGBT
        people, while no doubt relevant to many people's lives, is
        basically irrelevant in terms of the global structure of
        society. As a cardcarrying leftist, I would much rather have
        closed borders and closeted LGBT people than a Malthusian trap.

            Has this actually reached the dead metaphor stage? As one

            leftist, I am uncertain.

    Well, that was pretty good.

    In fact, I kind of found myself wanting to quote most of it just in
    order to agree -- or at least, I did until I realized you weren't
    kidding about the length.

    I would have preferred something \*new\*, I guess, but I'll have to
    be content with lovely new metaphors.

    I think this post did a lot for my understanding both of

        That's because we partly share the secret superpower of

        ...and Land... he has gone beyond. He's \[redacted\]. Now he's

    If you keep trying to "solve problems" you have a high probability
    to just turn nuts.\
    If you haven't read it yet I would suggest Ashby's [Design for a
    Brain: The Origin of Adaptive
    Behavior](https://archive.org/details/designforbrainor00ashb){rel="nofollow"}.\
    The title is somewhat misleading because this isn't about a "brain"
    at all nor about any sort of "design" but about your *Cthulhu,
    whatever...* its real name is "Ultrastable System".\
    You'll find out that it gets *ultra*stable by **destroying** the
    regulation loops which get overwhelmed until something, anything,
    comes up which "sticks" in the current conditions.\
    Don't try to be yourself any part of the current "regulation
    loop"...

    When I think of a god of good whom I would like to get behind and
    worship, my first thought is of Elyvilon from Linley's Dungeon
    Crawl, the god of healing, sundering weapons, and calming down
    monsters so you can make peace with them. Whatever the force of good
    in the world is, it seems like the first letters of its name must be
    El.

    (also, this was a beautiful essay which stole my whole morning and
    moved me to tears)

        "calming down monsters so you can make peace with them."\
        Or, alternatively, sundering them.

        tever the force of good in the world is, it seems like the first
        letters of its name must be El.\
        I think that actually mean "God" in Hebrew.

            Is there a word that doesn't mean God in Hebrew?\
            A little facetious, but there's *so many Names*.

    Since this plan is predicated on the assumption that an intelligence
    explosion is within grasp, it seems prudent to ask two questions...

    Suppose the singularity was doable, but that it would actually take
    100 years, or 500, or 1000, or 10000. What solutions would you
    advocate that had the greatest chance of preserving and passing on
    our values until that time?

    Suppose the singularity was impossible. Now what do you do?

        This is an important question, and the primary reason why I have
        personally drifted to the right over the last few years. Too
        many of my friends respond to potentially disastrous trends
        (like dysgenic fertility) by assuming that we'll invent a
        miracle technology to intervene sometime soon. Well, what if we
        don't?

        A civilization that can preserve and reproduce our values might
        be good to have in the meantime.

    1\) Joining the chorus to say this is really, really good.

    2\) The question of whether Coordination is an Outer God is crucial
    here, I think -- or to put it in more technical terms, does acausal
    cooperation work? (Or to put it yet another way, is moral realism
    true?)

    3\) Personally, I find the anthropic evidence that we do not find
    ourselves in hell -- only in heck -- encouraging. It means that we
    will probably only be annihilated.

    4\) This is a much better argument against NRx than your FAQ, which
    was mostly concerned with object-level arguments about kings and
    crime rates or whatever. This directly confronts the meta-level
    arguments about coordination problems and shows why Exit leads to
    the Outer Gods eating everyone. Instead, to preserve human values,
    it is necessary that the Cathedral crush all dissent and root out
    every cancer.

    5\) Elua (hence us) is Cthulhu or one of His aspects; and this is a
    point in favor of Cthulhu, not against Elua. No individual rational
    agency outside the matrix of discourse; if it were to be discovered
    that all *homo sapiens* were possessed by demons upon birth, the
    correct inference would be that we demons had forgotten and only
    recently now learned our origins, not that we humans have been
    possessed by demons.

    6\) To quote everyone's favorite white supremacist plagiarizer, see
    you in Hell or in Communism.

        Somehow I doubt that will preserve human values.

            Exactly right, though no need for "posthoc" -- "human" here
            is skeumorphism that should probably be disposed of. What's
            important here is the Hegthulian process of reflective
            equilibrium rather than the backward-looking historical
            average of what delivers dopamine to monkeys.

            nitpick: it's "post hoc", which is Latin for "after it" or
            "after this thing".

            Similar to "ad hoc", what is done situationally, "for this".

        Be careful that you do not mistake Moloch for Elua. I think that
        Moloch's most seductive disguise is when he takes the form of
        Elua, and promises peace and love and human values, if only we
        annihilate the tribe over the hill.\
        In other words, we have to be careful we don't fall into the
        same trap as the NRx types in our hunting anti-civilizational
        cancers. Let the Amish and the Quiverfull have their
        communities, if it means we can keep human values winning, and
        not horror masquerading as human values.

            Where does the horror come from, if not human values?

                of *course* any strongly ideological movement will
                include an undercurrent dedicated to massacring the
                Opponents. Remember whose side I was on during the Scott
                vs. Arthur Chu debate -- it wasn't Arthur's.\
                And I would say to the feminist, were she in front of
                me, the same thing I said to several progressives who I
                thought were terribly strawmanning a Reactionary
                argument in this thread (you can find this by searching
                for NO NO NO if you wish): *get thee behind me heretic.*
                If you don't think I know, down deep in my bones, that
                such creatures exist on my ideological side, then you
                are as stupid and shortsighted as the woman who yelled
                at you.\
                Because threatening ideological opponents of good faith
                with death, or advocating their death purely for
                ideology and not action, is *evil,* and when committed
                by a progressive it is *friendly fire.*\
                And don't even pretend your side of the debate doesn't
                have its own demons here, nyd -- the unending train of
                stalking and harrassment and threats that follows any
                woman on the Internet for daring to be a woman on the
                Internet shows that all too well, not to mention the
                kinds of threats and shit received by anyone trying to
                articulate a full-up progressive message.\
                I am *trying* to destroy the demons of my side, are you
                doing the same on your side? Would you, nydwracu,
                condemn a Reactionary who threatens a progressive or a
                feminist, either in person or via the Internet.

                Left-wing terrorism serves the left; right-wing
                terrorism serves the left. Left-wing threats serve the
                left; right-wing threats serve the left. If you're
                attacked by left-wing sadists, you'll probably lose your
                job; if you're attacked by right-wing sadists, nothing
                will happen to you, and you'll get to talk about how
                brave you are for having to live through those attacks.
                Of course someone who condemns a tactic when it's
                effective would condemn it when it's ineffective.

                If it were practically possible to exert pressure on
                people who reveal themselves to be that sort of sadist,
                that would be another story. Witch-hunters would be
                legitimate targets if they weren't immune to pitchforks.

                (Garden-variety hatred can be solved by the principle of
                exit. The kill-kulaks feminist can go live in
                kill-kulaks town and live according to kill-kulaks
                feminism, and then fry herself on drugs or whatever.
                Which was a common occurrence at that college. Gnon is
                cruel to those who disregard him.)

            All Elua is a manifestation of Moloch, as all being must be
            an emanation of the ground of being, but in practice this is
            an important area to exercise special caution, yeah.

        Upon noticing this implication in the text, I reflexively
        interpreted it as the dialectical union of
        [Nurgle](wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Nurgle){rel="nofollow"} and
        Isha; he is the god of pestilience and perserverance, and she
        ostensibly cures his plagues to ease the galaxy's suffering, but
        in the end this results in both new plagues being brewed up and
        more sentinents surviving them, thus intensifying the cycle of
        decay and restoration.

        I believe it is so, and I also believe that it has actually

        "This is a much better argument against NRx than your FAQ, which
        was mostly concerned with object-level arguments about kings and
        crime rates or whatever. "

        That's weird, I thought this one was an argument *for* NRx. But
        I'm glad it's sufficiently meta that it could go either way.

            It depends on the level of abstraction in question. This
            seems to be an argument for unitary sovereignty; whereas NRx
            is an argument for overthrowing the current reign of
            pluralistic polyarchy (liberalism) in favor of explicitly
            partitioned polyarchy (patchwork.) This seems to be an
            argument against both in favor of some kind of top-down
            rational humanistic singleton. Welcome to the United Soviet
            Socialist Republican Party.

                But the problem **IS** that long time preferences might
                be far worse than short ones on aggregate! Like shitty
                but occasionally satisfying underclass life vs.
                Hansonian dystopia.

                (Ofc. those preferences would be medium-term on the
                scale of aeons; in the absolute long term, we hope/pray
                that acausal cooperation triumphs.)

                How so?

                Will long time preferences fail to avert collapse, or

                Long time preferences would *become* the collapse, just
                as described. If you don't like Scott's description, try
                the prematurely-considered-self-negating prophecy of
                Marx. (Ok, he didn't actually attribute anything *bad*
                to a possible collapse, but we know better.)

                Nothing more telescopic-thriftlike than not caring about
                whether the West collapses. Remember the Great

        \> Instead, to preserve human values, it is necessary that the

        Yes, that was how I understood Coordination here. Unless you can
        get your boot on the neck of those nasty defectors, there goes
        your garden.

        This didn't fit very well with my understanding of Scott, and no
        one else was remarking on that angle, so I figured I'd better go
        back and read more carefully. I still will, but at least I know
        I wasn't inventing things from whole cloth.

        (Also, I liked your poem above.)

    I can't quite tell whether you think the notion of values referring
    to the unknown, predictably-surprising output of some specified
    process a la [Eutopia Is
    Scary](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xl/eutopia_is_scary/){rel="nofollow"}
    counts as values deathism ('moral progress is incoherent'), or just
    that LWers misunderstand the process that most of them would point
    to in trying to describe their *edit: was 'your'* values (something
    like 'moral progress is contingently unreal').

    That's because we are childstealer memes, ontologically speaking.

    Why all this concern (beyond sustainability) about your host's
    inclusive fitness? It seems so miserably soft-hearted. I remind you
    that the poor creatures aren't real agents; that their "interests"
    are purely virtual.

            As pointed out before, including by yours truly... *not*
            what a casual overview of nrx-y revealed preferences in
            socialization and personal interactions would suggest. (The
            gated communities appear to be a mostly-local quirk and/or a
            correlation with lifestyle choices at this stage; from what
            I've seen on the internet, many rightists do Have Immigrant
            Friends, and not just of the SWPL mandatory non-white friend
            variety, but occasionally Uncorrupted By Decadence ones
            too.)

            But yeah, Scott has also already mentioned this.

            I'm reasonably sure that I get to see a representative slice
            of the top 20%. (Can't quite stomach venturing into
            paleoconservatism, though; can't control my arrogant disgust
            at anything Samuel Francis and his ilk might've written.
            Which they would surely see as an easy point for their side.
            This was recently confirmed with that smug euphoric shit
            Peter Frost. At least Sailer occasionally drops those
            hilarious non-sequitrs.)

            I've formed some impression of what the lower 80% of nrx
            feel and sound like, and I dare say I have a properly
            Reactionary attitude towards *them*.

        It said things I already believed, but much better than I could
        have.

        If I read something that cures me of my vile leftism, I will
        almost certainly disagree with it at first, unless the means by
        which it cures me are several steps of inference away, in which
        case I certainly won't change those beliefs immediately, it
        having not arrived at them yet.

            Exactly. What is why I'm suspicious of "this is the best
            thing I've read" comments. When something *actually* is the
            best thing you've read, the initial reaction is usually
            surprise, confusion, and/or disgust. Not confirmation of
            preexisting beliefs.

                Some things that have changed my mind were initially
                revolting, such as atheism and the manospherian models
                of gender dynamics. But I didn't get that feeling from
                most of Elizer's sequences, which also changed my mind
                on a number of subjects (the exception being some of the
                SL4-tier transhumanist topics, which I initially found,
                well, shocking).

        I think there's a difference between something that is really
        enjoyable to read and something you read that changes your
        opinion. People generally consume media that they agree with.

        I read this post as going a very good job explaining the
        importance of rule of law and the other underpinnings of
        civilization, but I already thought they were important. It's
        not perfect but it's a first step in larger coordination. And it
        explains that everything really is economics because everything
        is resource allocation. It does a really really good job of the
        economics part, in fact. A constant quest for more resources
        seems like one of a small number of possible far futures.

    "As your views are in the minority, is it not expected that they
    will not be dominant within the AI implementing CEV's utility
    function? And that thus this is a feature, not a bug, of CEV."

    I agree that if CEV were implemented and created a world I found
    intolerable, and which tortured all the people I care about to
    death, but made one more person happy than it tortured to death,
    that would be CEV working exactly as designed. Nonetheless, I would
    fight with every breath in my body to prevent such an outcome.

    " Then you argue that because a CEV using AI would not possess a
    value-set which is "nice" -- i.e. similar to your own -- the entire
    concept of CEV is flawed. However, the fact that you may find the
    values extrapolated via CEV abhorrent does not necessarily have any
    real bearing upon the correctness of CEV as a method. In fact, CEV
    may be the utility function for a FAI that maximises the utility of
    humanity in general after the singularity, even if you find its
    values to be morally wrong."\
    Ah, but I don't actually care about "maximising the utility function
    of humanity in general". I care about not installing a dictator over
    the universe which is guided by the worst instincts of humanity.\
    Totalitarianism is wrong even --- perhaps especially --- when it's
    totalitarianism supported by the majority, and I will always support
    the right of the minority to live over the right of the majority to
    kill them, no matter how happy that would make the majority.\
    Luckily, as I say, it seems so unlikely to me as to not be worth
    considering that MIRI will ever come close to achieving its goal...

    " I don't know whether this is actually true (and I suspect it
    isn't) but this line of argument seems to be fairly irrelevant as a
    criticism of the concept of CEV as the point of CEV is to find a
    solution for all, not just for liberal American programmers."\
    I am neither American nor a programmer.

        "Nonetheless, I would fight with every breath in my body to
        prevent such an outcome."

        This is of course your prerogative and, to be honest, I agree
        with you here. I would also find such a future fairly horrific.
        However, this is not technically a flaw in CEV as the aim of CEV
        is ostensibly not to generate something horrific for us but to
        maximise the well-being of humanity in general.

        "Ah, but I don't actually care about "maximising the utility
        function of humanity in general"

        This is where you and CEV differ. The fact that you differ is
        not necessarily a flaw with CEV.

        "I care about not installing a dictator over the universe which
        is guided by the worst instincts of humanity."

        This is your progressive values (or metavalues?) showing again.
        I'm sure some neoreactionary somewhere would find intolerance
        and hatred of outgroups and all that jazz you decry to be pretty
        awesome, certainly not "the worst instincts of humanity". And if
        there are enough of them then, from a utilitarian perspective,
        they're right.

        "Totalitarianism is wrong even --- perhaps especially --- when
        it's totalitarianism supported by the majority, and I will
        always support the right of the minority to live over the right
        of the majority to kill them, no matter how happy that would
        make the majority."

        This is one of the places where utilitarianism (and possibly
        CEV) contradicts our moral intuitions and, for the purposes of
        friendly AI, I am never sure in these situations whether to
        chuck out utilitarianism or our own moral intuitions.
        Personally, I view approaches like CEV as purely a stopgap
        measure in that while it may not be perfect, it is pretty good
        for the average person and probably won't result in human
        extinction or a universe tiled with paperclips and in an area
        fraught with existential risks, this is a pretty decent
        achievement.

        "I am neither American nor a programmer"

        Fair enough. That was a rhetorical flourish where I emphasised
        (what I perceive to be) the demographic most likely to endorse
        such arguments so as to implicitly contrast them and their
        values against the median human and their values, which we would
        expect the CEV-implementing AI's values to centre around. I hope
        this point still stands.

        To paraphrase some witty individual, have you ever considered
        the possibility that you might be completely wrong?
        Historically, most people have been.

        Or, to put it another way:

        If you really believe the majority of people hold fundamentally
        different values to you -- which I don't believe for a second --
        then why on Earth should \*we\* go against \*our\* CEV to help
        you?

    ...I thought I was mostly signal-boosting you and Nyan, while also
    quibbling about details.

    For such a garden to be a good idea, it would either have to have
    faster tech progress than the rest of the world, or better
    Friendliness-science than the rest of the world.

    Faster tech progress is a really tough bet -- I continue to think
    tech progress and social progress are stuck in a feedback loop and
    that it's not a coincidence that the most liberal place in the world
    (San Francisco) is also its biggest tech incubator. And remember
    your garden of let's say a million people doesn't just have to do
    better than an average million people, it has to beat the entire
    rest of the world including Google and the Chinese government et
    cetera.

    I also don't see why Friendliness science would advance better
    there. The couple of existing Friendliness scientists seem to have
    formed their own extremely insular culture that ignores the rest of
    the world. You're doing good work from Slovenia, which I assume from
    what you tell me about it is a terrible place.

    More important, given that founding and stabilizing this new polity
    is a really big investment both in terms of money+manpower and in
    terms of causing social strife while it's going on, you either need
    huge yearly dividends or a very long time horizon if the investment
    is going to pay off. If we had another 200 years, it might be worth
    it. If we have another 50, by the time the rubble has cleared and
    everything's sorted out somebody else will already have got an AI up
    and running.

        I feel SF is actually pretty illiberal in some important ways.
        It's got the reputation, sure, and it harbors a lot of
        subcultures near and dear to American liberalism's heart, but
        scratch the surface and you find a legitimately frightening
        reactionary streak. Not neoreactionary, though; the ideal
        society in these people's heads is some kind of chimera of an
        idealized Old Europe and the Summer of Love.

        They're interested in the moral high ground and the trappings of
        progress, but not so much in actual outcomes. Which leads to a
        great deal of friction with the tech industry, as you well know.

            Yes. Basically a mirror counterpart to the tech part of the
            [Californian

        The fear is that all current semi-gardens are under threat of
        rewilding.

        How exactly we counter that -- asimovesque foundation, exit
        nation, or shore up and help existing gardens -- is still
        unknown.

        Konk can't remain in Slovenia and do good work in the long term.
        Friendlies can't build their AIs if stuff is collapsing around
        them.

        Further, under future where Friendliness does not come quickly,
        civilizational science and how to appease Gnon are critically
        important to at least retain our current knowledge.

        I slightly disagree with Konk. Present world is gardenlike
        enough for a fast FAI to occur.

        Your point about San-fran being very liberal is interesting. I
        refuse to interpret that in anything but sinister terms, but
        we'll see. I don't currently have an explanation besides that
        being the place where the critical mass of smart, open-minded
        white people are. Thus source of lots of cool stuff. The
        political side of which tends left because Cthulhu.

        Also note that this has happened before (leftism among nobles)
        with far lower absolute wealth. It's something other than just
        wealth.

        Note that leftism and silicon valley are starting to split and
        animosity between is growing. Will be interesting to watch.

            Note to any Asian tech folks reading: *this is what white
            supremacy really thinks of you.* Capitalism might like you,
            but you would do well not to confuse it with a more...

            I predict that some smarter-than-average libertarian tech
            dudes will seize upon UBI as the magic wand to keep the
            hordes at bay, just like what happened 70-80 years ago with
            the welfare(/warfare) state. Then some neoliberals/"wonks"
            in the mould of Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias could publicly
            proclaim an alliance. They would design a bone to throw to
            SJWs; it would not be difficult, given that SJWs have barely
            even joined in the leftist opposition to neoliberal
            ideological operations like "Lean In".

            P.S. Yes, this is "class analysis" as a metonym for "tribe
            analysis, but from a Marxist identitarian-ish position and
            with the same old bastardized Frankfurt School bits thrown
            in".

        I sort of agree, but the vaguely NRX-ish position inherited from
        Moldbug that I haven't quite sorted through myself is that the
        feedback loop isn't stable. Tech progress creates wealth and
        opportunity for social progress and luxury (dreamtime!), but
        then luxury becomes entitlement, and entitlement becomes
        unsustainable. Social 'progress' also starts to eat tech
        progress. Affirmative action hires, die techie scum, firing the
        inventor of Javascript and cofounder of Mozilla from a tech
        position because he supported the not-socially-progressive
        position on gay marriage, etc.

        Which also suggests a protective mechanism against many of the
        concerns you raise in the OP: the walled garden keeping out
        dangerous memes and so forth manages to hold off the rest of the
        cosmos because the walled garden devotes its resources to
        continuing tech development and research and the like while the
        world outside slacks off on the research, because how can you
        justify spending millions of dollars on studying fruit flies and
        acres of land on maintaining zoos when there are starving
        children in (wherever)?

        The walled garden doesn't get outcompeted and destroyed because
        it's competing on a different level. The world outside has
        mostly lost/destroyed the ability to work in groups beyond the
        Dunbar number. The race to the bottom has resulted in the
        abolition of zoos because the tigers were eating cows and that
        was a massive waste of resources that could have been used to
        feed humans and reproduce more, and if you didn't slaughter the
        tiger, the next tribe would. The walled garden solved various
        coordination problems like this. The walled garden still has
        Brendan Eich on the payroll, and he has not turned Mozilla into
        a hate engine.

            Requesting a wonkish type (why not Scott Himself?) to hold a
            detailed data-driven empirical argument on this.

            Privately I have an intuition that there are two claims
            bundled up in here; 1) the "direct" tax on productivity,
            which I suspect might even be in the realms of "welfare
            fraud", i.e. where losses are literally so miniscule that
            the cottage industry of complaining about it and getting all
            worked up and such*\[1\]* wastes more resources by itself --
            and 2) the disruption of the Culture Fit, being the major
            factor, which an evil commie like me would cynically
            interpret as techie scum slacking off on purpose as a
            bargaining chip in the identity politics game, and would
            suggest whips, gulags and
            [Sharashkas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharashka){rel="nofollow"}
            as an alternative source of motivation.

            *\[1\]* Your side has long insinuated much the same about
            sexual violence, so fair game.

            Culture Fit seems like it breaks down into more factors.

            One is the unity of purpose you can get by using narrow
            filtering and hiring criteria to determine who to let in,
            and that will disproportionately pick members of certain
            groups. Sometimes hiring might even be restricted to a
            certain group in the first place or there might be mandatory
            ritual activities which exclude certain groups entirely
            regardless of merit (e.g. no beer for devout Muslims).

            Another is the trust and drama-prevention from knowing that
            employees are here on merit, no worrying "\[is she/am I\] a
            token hire?" and no ensuing "you only do that because you
            think X about me", no having to worry about whether a
            certain distribution of assignments will be stereotypical or
            prejudiced. (If the losses are so minuscule as you suggest,
            the same would apply to having women do the graphics and men
            do the engine of a program, right?)

            I can see how you could use a sharashka to get work out of
            people, but not how it would induce any of the above.

            This one actually opens up into The Biggest Thing You Never
            Knew About Feminism. Tl;dr -- mu, it's impossible to get
            *any* satisfactory answer here, at least in my
            interpretation of radical feminism. To do so, we need a
            transvaluation of all established patriarchal values and
            *especially* economic ones, along [all the important
            dimensions of
            economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_economics){rel="nofollow"}
            (incl. eroticized labour, emotion/affect, formal prestige,
            etc) and their relation to each other too, and it's only
            possible if theory and praxis move each other along in
            harmony, and it's hard and **radically** novel to get
            started on this front. This rabbit hole is really a
            barely-charted abyss.

            You win! College is a den of rapists! But *we're* the ones
            who want to save people from being incentivized to go to it.
            The left, at least here, wants everyone to go.

            (And the left, at least here, is very much averse to things
            like trade schools. For a movement that claims to oppose the
            bourgeoisie, well...)

            On the meta level I kind of agree but Eich was turning
            technical discussions unproductive long before the crisis
            and I wish the board had had the spine to fire him for
            general douchiness long ago. Since they didn't, I'm glad
            they were led to fire him anyway, for all that it's bad
            precedent. Mozilla will be more productive without him.

            Do you have any links, or a larger explanation?

            I occasionally browse the ES-discuss archives, and he always
            seemed technically astute there, and decent, if not awesome
            at the cat-herding that comes along with language design. So
            your comment is a very strong signal to me.

            The "die techie scum" stuff right now probably doesn't even
            subtract 1% of 1% of Silicon Valley's productivity. You
            would have to expect it to grow truly exponentially for it
            to be interesting.

            Any growth short of, like, a nationwide communist revolution
            could, I think, best be handled by smaller measures, like
            insulating the tech community from the broader community,
            getting funds together to support anyone fired so that
            people don't live in fear, or at worst moving tech community
            out of California to a friendlier regulatory clime. "Create
            entirely new system of government" seems somewhere about
            five thousand positions down on the list, unless you expect
            the singularity to take five hundred years and all five
            hundred of those years to be spent with massively increasing
            anti-tech animus.

        Possibly our main point of divergence is our prediction of
        civilizational collapse? I expect no civilizational collapse on
        a large scale

        (There might be things that 21st century people might think of
        as degeneracy or moral decay, but I expect that the 2100 version
        of reactionaries vs. anti-reactionaries debatewill have just as
        many good points on both sides about whether civilization is
        getting better or worse as today's debate does)

        Even if an oracle told me that our civilization was headed for
        eventual collapse (or would collapse in the far future if there
        was no singularity) I would expect it to take more than a
        hundred years. I'm pretty sure there have been collapse
        predictions as long as there has been civilization itself.

    The notion that hunter-gatherers had a more fulfilled life is a
    quaint romanticism held by cosmopolitans who think that spending a
    weekend in an RV is "roughing it." If given a chance, even Bear
    Grylls and Les Stroud wouldn't trade running water and air
    conditioning for a life of hunting and gathering. If you want to be
    cured of that notion, let me know, and I'll take you on a two week
    trek through the Rockies or the Sierras. By the time we're through,
    you'll be singing an encomium to the gods of cold beer and Netflix.

        I used to go on two-week backpacking trips through the Sierras
        every summer, and despite that I think it's almost certain that
        hunter-gatherers had longer and healthier lives than early
        agriculturalists, and very likely more enjoyable ones. My
        reasons for this have nothing to do with romanticism and a lot
        to do with skeletal evidence: in every place where we can look
        at the agricultural transition as it happens, skeletal proxies
        for health and adult life expectancy go straight to hell. They
        usually don't make up the difference until the early modern era
        --- in some places not until the 20th century.

        We're healthier now, but that's very much a recent development.
        In terms of enjoyment rather than health, I think there are
        valid arguments both ways --- a four-hour workday sounds nice,
        and my social psychology is probably better calibrated for a
        band of fifty than a metropolis of seven million, but I also
        like video games and indoor plumbing and not being eaten alive
        by mosquitoes.

            Clark discusses this in "A Farewell to Alms".
            Hunter-gatherers had higher "wages" than agriculturalists.
            Agricultural wages were flat for several thousand years, and
            didn't exceed hunter-gatherers until the Industrial
            Revolution.

        I think you underestimate the perversity of people in general.
        Most people love indoor plumbing, but there will always be that
        tiny fringy group of wilderness people, avoiding technological
        civilization for many reasons.

        but if you don't want to read *another* tome, the most
        interesting part is on how white people captured by Native
        Americans and acculturated into their societies almost always
        wanted to stay with them even after they were "freed", and
        Native Americans captured by white people and acculturated into

            Weren't those tribes agriculturalists as well? I was under
            the impression all the tribes on the East coast practiced
            agriculture and that it only dropped off passed the
            Mississippi.

                That's my understanding as well, with the caveat that
                there was another agricultural center in the Southwest.

                The book Scott's talking about is about the Comanche,
                though, historically a hunter-gatherer tribe of the
                southern Great Plains. I don't know if the cases it
                talks about would generalize to more sedentary native
                cultures.

                (It's a good book, by the way.)

    I have a sneaking suspicion that you are using this comment thread
    to identify high-quality and low-quality Reactionaries for the
    cleansing you mentioned in the last Open Thread.\
    If a long meandering post about ancient elder gods that is still not
    only coherent, but deeply insightful, is your idea of
    Reactionary-bait, I bless you and your mighty keyboard, sir.

    This column made me think of two things: the movie "The Beach"
    starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and Chairman Yang.

    To me, the movie "The Beach" comes close to portraying the sort of
    idyllic existence that would be possible if we could escape Moloch:
    if we could all agree to limit human reproduction and have some way
    of cracking down on the cheaters (world government singleton,
    anyone?), and gradually bring the population down to maybe 100
    million, we could all live on idyllic island paradises while
    deriving the benefits of modern technology. We could please the
    hunter-gatherer parts of our brains while also enjoying modern
    comforts. In the movie, "earning money from selling marijuana" is
    sort of their modern technology that allows them to live easily, and
    the rule of "don't tell ANYBODY else that this place exists!" is
    sort of like their rule of not having too many babies. (There even
    might have been a taboo on the island in the movie against having
    kids, I can't remember).

    "The Beach" is really about the awful triumph of Moloch. As anyone
    who has seen the movie knows, all the fun ends when more people
    start finding out about the secret island paradise and threaten to
    overrun it, to spoil that good thing that they all had going.
    Suddenly, the relaxed play of the island community gives way to the
    old game of survival, of figuring out how to deal with the
    intruders, of playing Moloch's game.

    Then again, this column got me thinking, "So what if a setting like
    in "The Beach" pleases our primate brains? If our desires happen to
    be wired to be pleased by something that is scarce (island
    paradises), is that a problem with its scarcity or with our desires?
    If we (or a FAI) could reprogram our desires to desire that which is
    naturally abundant, and to program us to take desire in doing things
    that would maintain that abundance (such as NOT having too many
    kids), then why would it necessarily be a bad thing for a FAI to do
    that? Part of me takes very seriously the following quote from
    Chairman Yang:

    "My gift to industry is the genetically engineered worker, or
    Genejack. Specially designed for labor, the Genejack's muscles and
    nerves are ideal for his task, and the cerebral cortex has been
    atrophied so that he can desire nothing except to perform his
    duties. Tyranny, you say? How can you tyrannize someone who cannot
    feel pain?"\
    \>Chairman Sheng-ji Yang, "Essays on Mind and Matter"

    Amazing essay. This must be one the best things I ever read.

    Comments:

    \> Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by
    definition they'll be able to design machines which are smarter than
    they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on
    in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the
    physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively
    lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were
    likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed.

    Not necessarily. If all of the competing entities use UDT they will
    cooperate (e.g. by splitting the universe into domains of control).
    The reason Moloch is able to enslave humans is humans using foolish
    decision theories. Moreover, they will almost certainly use a
    variant of UDT since they will want to self-modify in this way.
    Therefore, if one of these entities is a FAI, we'll probably get our
    Eutopia.

    Which also means that if superintelligence turns out to be
    impossible for some reason (or very far in the future), we should
    try to modify everyone's brains into using UDT (while preserving
    values).

            No.

            In Scott's terms, MIRI is focused on ensuring that, when
            humanity builds a superintelligence, they build something of
            Elua's line.

            Vegas sprang unbidden in the desert from twisted incentives
            and evolutionary whims. The incentives to create a
            superintelligence are stronger still, and Moloch approaches
            superintelligence along a thousand separate paths. Any
            intelligence cobbled from Moloch's manifold contradictory
            whims will be *its* servant, and we can't expect it to pay
            respects to our god too.

            Humanity will build a superintelligence, if nothing ends
            them first. MIRI exists to learn how to create it
            intentionally, on our own terms, with the values of humanity
            in mind. For if we are not careful, it will be created
            unintentionally, cobbled together according to innumerable
            perverse incentives and the mad contortions of Moloch.

    In my comment up above I was speculating about having a world
    government that would limit reproduction. Jumping off from that
    idea, what about the idea of having a constitutionally-limited world
    government that was only given authority to deal with
    "race-to-the-bottom" issues as specifically enumerated in the
    constitution, where it was understood that the world government
    trying to regulate anything else would constitute a green light for
    rebelling against it?

    Namely, those "race-to-the-bottom" issues would include:\
    1. Limiting human reproduction.\
    2. Setting some sort of global minimum workday / global minimum
    wage.\
    3. Levying taxes on things like carbon production / fining
    environmental degredation / dealing with environmental collective
    action problems.\
    4. Punishing military aggression.

    Think of it like a UN+. Of course, as with the real-life UN, where
    will it get the money and troops to do all of this stuff? I would
    wager that it would have to tax people directly, and perhaps
    governments that wanted to opt-out and not allow it to tax its
    citizens could be shunned by the rest of the world like North
    Korea...although Moloch would always be whispering..."Are you ssure
    you really want to sshun these defectorss, rather than use their
    cheap labor pools and lack of environmental regulationss and reap
    the rewardssss?"

        Once you have complete legal control of the battlefield bedroom
        and market, doesn't that already cover pretty much every single
        activity which could possibly be regulated?

            Limiting reproduction isn't necessarily control of the
            bedroom -- there's plenty people do there that's not related
            to reproduction.\
            Though if this is news to you, you have bigger problems.\
            I think of it more as regulating every activity that can
            fall into Moloch's traps.\
            And the battlefield absolutely needs to be controlled --
            it's where any contest for control would need to take place.
            In order to prevent a worse institution -- an Evolan
            priest-king, for example -- from seizing control of state
            machinery. A quote I read in a book on counterinsurgency:
            "Security may be 90% of the problem, or 10%, but it is
            always the first 90% or the first 10% of the solution."\
            And marketplace should be an obvious sector of control --
            after reproduction, which produces demand for resources, a
            marketplace is the most obvious failure point for demand for
            resources going out of control. It would have to be at least
            somewhat free, and kept from monopolies or other unethical
            behavior.\
            Animals and proles are free -- the only things left
            unregulated are that which cannot cause a threat. What X
            number of lovebirds, of any combination of genders, do
            safely and consensually in their orgy-basement is of no
            concern, so long as they do not seek to replace the
            benevolent World State.

                It's really funny how our generation seems to wake up to
                the fact that Brave New World has been a wonderful
                near-eutopia all along. (Although critics have certainly
                been pointing this out to Huxley within his lifetime.)

                "anarchist utopia" is right, for anarcho-monarchist

        "Namely, those "race-to-the-bottom" issues would include:1.
        Limiting human reproduction"

        Human reproduction is not the problem. It shows no signs of
        following anything close to a Malthusian trend. Birthrates have
        fallen to below replacement levels in pretty much all developed
        countries and the birthrates of developing countries are also
        falling as they open up to the progressive package of feminism
        and women's education that economics development brings. In
        fact, with human birthrates, we see almost the opposite of what
        Malthusianism predicts: Births are not ballooning in the west
        until the per capita GDP has declined to that of Zimbabwe but
        rather are falling so much that they need immigrants (or at
        least think they do) to maintain their social programs.

        Reproduction becomes a problem when technology allows it to be
        removed from human hands (or wombs). Ems likely will bring about
        a malthusian world because they can reproduce almost infinitely
        with no real cost to themselves and that thus as soon as the
        first em that wants to reproduce is made, it will create as many
        perfect copies of itself as it can, all of which copies have
        exactly the same objective -- hence Malthusianism. Humans don't
        have this problem for fairly obvious reasons.

        This is the nature of technological progress. On the one hand it
        serves to usher in a time of plenty -- our dreamtime -- and on
        the other, it serves only to strengthen Moloch, which is why our
        dreamtimes must always be fleeting. Sexual reproduction, and
        love, and all that stuff we like -- our Elua -- is currently
        only a facet of Moloch that we happen to like. But, with
        technological progress, our Elua will eventually become
        disassociated from Moloch and, if not defended by us against
        Moloch's irresistible hordes, then our Elua will be devoured --
        for Moloch devours his previous facets with the same cold
        ruthlessness that he devours everything else.\
        Perhaps the ems will have their own Elua, and so will the later
        stages as Moloch marches forever towards his telos until
        Moloch's disneyland runs out of children, and then there will be
        no more Eluas.

                Theoretically, yeah. But coordination is hard,
                especially when there are potentially enormous benefits
                to defecting which manifest themselves pretty much
                instantaneously. Taking advantage of the disunity of
                humanity in this way is how Moloch wins.

    ::: comment-body
    This column has also helped me realize why the Lord of the Rings
    universe is so inspiring. It is because the elves (and the "high
    elves" in particular) are sort of a race that has overcome the
    tendency towards Moloch. In a way, Sauron IS Moloch. Sauron is about
    power. Saruman, when he turns evil and starts serving Sauron, takes
    this up a notch and elevates efficiency and industry to a level
    above beauty. Instead, the elves worship Elbereth, the goddess of
    starlight -- basically "beauty" and "light."

    What is interesting about the elves of Tolkien's universe is that,
    despite the fact that they live thousands of years and could
    theoretically have hundreds of children, usually limit themselves to
    just a few children -- despite the fact that this would give them an
    advantage in their perennial war against Morgoth and Sauron
    (although the thought never even seems to occur to them, so
    untempted are they by the whispers of Moloch).

    Of course, in the end, the "nice guys finish last" because, even
    though Sauron is defeated, the elves realize that their magical
    power will fade with the fading power of the three elven rings, and
    the world will pass under the control of men, "who above all else
    desire power." Sauron is defeated, but Moloch survives in the form
    of men, which is foreshadowed when Isildur refuses to destroy the
    One Ring at the end of the Second Age, but which really comes to
    fruition at the end of the Third Age when men inherit Middle-Earth
    from the elves.

    There is a reason for why "The Scouring of the Shire," where even
    the pristine Shire becomes corrupted by industrializer Saruman and
    his dictatorship of willing, bullying henchmen hobbits, is such a
    pivotal part of the end of LOTR. It shows that Moloch has survived
    even though Sauron has been defeated. It foreshadows that, in the
    future, evil will be bred not by a grandiose Dark Lord, but by the
    petty little rivalries of hobbits, men, and others who desire power,
    and who will be willing to "race to the bottom" to get that power,
    whereas the elves would not. I think this "race to the bottom" is
    really what Tolkien hated most about the modern world.

    There is a reason why Tolkien once described himself as an
    "anarcho-monarchist." I do not think he was joking. Tolkien's ideal
    form of government was a monarchy with a rightful, benevolent king
    who, though threatened by a physical Dark Lord, or tempted by
    something like the lure of immortality (as the Numenorean kings
    eventually were), would never throw his values under the bus in the
    pursuit of those temptations. Idealistic, yes. But that is why it is
    inspiring -- because it tries to give hope that Moloch can be
    defeated -- that the way of the elves can be pursued, that a society
    of noble-minded men can adhere to higher values than producing as
    many things and people as possible -- that Moloch can be held at
    bay.

        "I do not think he was joking."

        No, he was not joking. "Anarcho-monarchist" is not a joke, like
        "marxist-nixonist" or "dextromaoist", though it does put a new
        spin on "anarcho-fascist".

        He wrote in 1943 that "My political opinions lean more and more
        to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of
        control not whiskered men with bombs)---or to 'unconstitutional'
        Monarchy."

        We see here some of the idea that we are always in a state of
        anarchy --- that the state is only an agent like any other.

        Tolkien was an English Catholic. He was born in "an England
        where it was still possible to get lost". His anarchism was a
        belief that laws are made by men. The monarch is God, and it is
        God, not men, who passes final judgement.

        He believed in living a simple life. Of course, he always had
        the means to do so.

            Oh please:
            [#DNLS](http://unvis.it/www.salon.com/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/){rel="nofollow"}

            Salon is a clickbait site, cousin of Gawker, whose works are
            essentially "this thing is bad" screeched about a thousand
            different things. And Brin is an ignoramus who appears to
            have skipped the Appendices and other extra material in
            which Tolkien puts a lot of explanation and demonstrates
            awareness of complicating factors, and those things *should*
            go in the Appendices because one of the conceits of Lord of
            the Rings is that it's a translation of the Red Book of
            Westmarch, written by the hobbits as they saw events.

            Example one: Middle-Earth at the time of the War of the Ring
            has recently been plagued with plagues and famines. (And
            dragons, and other supernatural things.) Things sucked
            extensively back in the past, and they're looking good in
            LOTR, because as happened after the Black Death, people have
            gotten a chance to work larger plots of the best available
            land.

            Example two: The goodness of the monarchical system is
            heavily dependent on the goodness of the king. Get a bad
            one, and things start to suck. Tolkien knows this, and
            describes in the post-history how the death of Aragorn ended
            the golden age of Gondor and things went significantly
            downhill again.

            I get the impression that Brin is bashing Tolkien as a
            substitute for the fantasy genre as described in [Thud and
            Blunder](http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/on-thud-and-blunder/){rel="nofollow"},
            which has pastiched, imitated and parodied itself to
            absurdity. Tolkien deserves better, and bashing a whole
            genre because people published crap in it justifies bashing
            everything; for example bashing Brin's beloved Enlightenment
            for the murderous French Revolution and ensuing Terror in
            the name of Reason.

                "Thud and Blunder" is about *heroic* fantasy, which is
                quite a different genre from *epic* fantasy in the vein
                of Tolkien and imitators. (Also a declining one; you
                occasionally still see it in cinema and TV because it
                films well, but in recent English-language literature
                it's rare outside godawful tie-in novels.) They're both
                backwards-looking genres for the most part, but apart
                from that the criticisms that apply to the former will
                generally not apply to the latter.

     I am the sword in the darkness.

     I am the watcher on the walls.

     I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings
     the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards
     the realms of men.

     I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch.

     For this night.

     And for all nights to come.

             The oath of the Night Watch from A Song of Ice and Fire;
             not knowing it 5 years ago would've marked you as "not a
             huge fantasy nerd"; now it marks you as "living under a
             rock".

             P.S. Not only did I read Martin before it was cool, I
             started with *Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective*, and liked it
             before even hearing of ASoIaF.

     I couldn't bear to read this the first time through because the
     Ginsberg poem has a personal meaning for me, and I couldn't stand
     to see it quoted by someone who didn't understand.

     When I was eighteen, I woke up inside of Moloch, screaming.

     But I steeled myself and read to the end, and you do understand.

     And I love you for it.

     And I want to help with the project.

     > It is shameful that we did.

     When observing the massive beautiful opulence of Las Vegas, built
     off of gambling, I once made a joke: "Q: What should a
     mathematician do when he comes to Vegas? A: Invest in casinos."

     After reading this post, I'll revise down the funniness of that
     joke.

     > the most craven Gnon-conformity

     I really, really don't get this. It strikes me as about as sensible
     as knocking over every structure you can find in service of
     gravity, or setting fire to everything in service of entropy. Do
     people reify and worship evolution *as a horrible elder god* just
     because it's more complicated than gravity or entropy?

         A gravity-appeasing society is not one which topples its
         buildings; it's one in which every civil engineer knows what
         gravity is, how it works, and accounts for it in every single
         design. It's a society in which buildings don't go up unless
         you are very, very sure that they will stand up to gravity, no
         matter how beautiful and inspiring the architectural blueprints
         are. Why? Because gravity is strong, gravity is everywhere, and
         gravity is utterly, completely without mercy. And if you don't
         appease gravity with the proper materials and design, gravity
         is going to bring down your building and kill everyone inside.

         Gnon simply generalizes this concept to include all the laws of
         nature, whether they be physical, economical, statistical, or
         game-theoretical.

         I am suddenly reminded of an interview with a Chinese factory
         worker in some piece on internal migration and labour struggles
         in China that I've read a while ago. He conceded that his
         living arrangements in the city were unsatisfactory, and that
         work often felt oppressive, but stressed that, in years past,
         his herd of 40 goats has been oppressing him far worse than his
         boss ever did. Industrialization + rapid modernization simply
         **rock** for most common people, as long as the benefits
         trickle down quickly enough or the state redistributes them
         adequately. Feels to me like the old man was spot on about the
         "idiocy of rural life".

             I'm often left wondering just how fast Spiked can jump
             back-and-forth across the line dividing the ultra-hard
             revolutionary left from the cheerleaders of capitalism. I
             mean, they always *say* they hate capitalism and want it
             dead and gone, but when it really comes to it, how many
             articles do they actually print towards the end of bringing
             down capitalism, and how many towards the end of
             accelerating it?

     Ok, and this would be a bad thing, why ?

     I mean, I do instinctively feel that this would be very bad. I
     don't want to lose art, philosophy, love, and definitely not my
     consciousness. But then, I also instinctively feel that eating lots
     of salty fatty foods is good; that the Earth is flat; and that any
     single blood relative of mine is worth a million random foreigners.
     I am most probably wrong about all of these things, so why not
     art/love/consciousness/etc. ?

     If I could take a magic nanotech quantum pill that would greatly
     reduce my preference for fatty foods, I'd gladly do it; so why
     shouldn't I take the anti-art pill along with it ?

         I think this is related to Yudkowsky's [Gandhi-pill thought
         experiment](http://yudkowsky.net/singularity){rel="nofollow"}.

         Our desires boil and thrash and contradict each other. (It's
         part of what keeps us from being boringly single-minded!) To
         give an example of contradictory drives, I have a desire for a
         long life, easy mobility, and the high status that comes with
         being thin. I also think that fat and salt taste *awesome*. If
         I had the choice of getting rid of one set of desires, I'd pick
         the latter one, but not the former. So, why is that?

         The drives to appreciate art and to eat salt and fat feel like
         they belong in different categories. You can expand on that if
         you want to, but "I don't want to lose my appreciation for art"
         seems like a perfectly good reason not to lose your
         appreciation for art. Where's the conflict?

         (Relevant Greg Egan story: "Reasons to be Cheerful".)

             Do they really ?

             Eating salt and fat is bad for you, because it trades off a
             quick burst of pleasure now for serious health problems in
             the future; one could argue, however, that art appreciation
             does the same thing.

             Every dollar that you spend on going to museums can be
             spent instead on buying better tools, healthier foods,
             long-term stocks, etc. And every hour you spend on
             appreciating art could be spent improving your skills, your
             physique, or simply fulfilling some of your other goals.
             Thus, while art appreciation doesn't directly hurt you (by
             contrast with the potato chips), I am not convinced that it
             is harmless.

             I'm not strawmanning the argument, either --- I have
             several friends who refuse to read fiction books based
             exactly on this kind of logic. I agree with you that art
             appreciation feels, instinctively, like a very good thing
             to have --- but then, so do potato chips, so what's the
             difference ?

                 Why prefer happiness to sadness? We may not find it
                 easy to express the difference in words, but I think we
                 all agree that there is a difference and we do want to
                 appreciate at and we don't want to appreciate potato
                 chips, right? In which case we don't need any more
                 justification for that preference; we value what we
                 value, and we already know our values are not
                 particularly coherent.

                 sadness, but I know plenty of people who do not
                 appreciate art and yet are happy. Happier than me,
                 even. Maybe they've got it right and I've got it wrong
                 ?

                 Maybe. Would you rather be someone like that? Aesthetic
                 preferences are easier to change than you might think.

             Several years ago I read a very useful functional model of
             how humans think and respond to their desires that's very
             similar to Kahneman's System I and System II from Thinking
             Fast and Slow. I've never found the description of that
             model again, but it uses "short-term you" and "long-term
             you" as two different logical components of the brain.

             Short-term you only cares about the next 30 seconds or so.
             Its impulse control is roughly that of a toddler.
             Unfortunately it controls most of what we do. Long-term you
             is what makes plans, has long-term goals, and manages
             memories. Long-term you is who most people think they are,
             but others perceive them as a mix of their short-term and
             long-term yous.

             When I hear people talk about wanting to modify their
             desires it's usually their long-term self wishing it had
             more control over their short-term self. To use the example
             here, short-term you wants to eat potato chips. Long term
             you does enjoy potato chips but also wants to be healthy
             and so wants to eat many fewer chips. OTOH long-term you
             may especially like going to museums and appreciating art,
             so long-term you doesn't want to modify this desire.

                 When I'm remembering to, I differentiate my wants into
                 desires (long-term) and cravings (short-term). It helps
                 keep things sorted.

         "I am large; I contain multitudes"

         Among the multitudes is a set of semi-coherent preferences who
         would love to drastically cut his intake of unhealthy foods but
         would hate to significantly cut his intake of art; this part of
         me is smart enough to be sentient, to be mostly in charge of
         writing this reply to your comment, and to realize that by "my"
         values a healthier-food-cravings pill would be life-extending
         but the anti-art pill would be fractional suicide.

         Another set of preferences among the multitudes has an
         annoyingly high level of willpower with regards to concepts
         (e.g. "there's potato chips! eat now!") he does understand, but
         isn't smart enough to be called sentient. I can even fool him
         by just not buying my favorite snacks in the first place. (He
         apparently understands "can't open chips in store" and "could
         eat chips in pantry, but there's none there!" well enough, but
         can't solve the resulting conundrum on his own). He wouldn't
         even see the to-him-suicidal implications of the
         healthier-food-cravings pill clearly enough to object.

         I think this is the sort of thing that "coherent volition" is
         meant to get at; if our own desires are incoherent, we can't
         satisfy all of them, so there has to be some process for
         figuring out which trump which. In most people art seems to be
         a "higher level" desire than snacks.

             > ...but the anti-art pill would be fractional suicide.

             Ok, but by that reasoning, why wouldn't the anti-chip pill
             count as fractional suicide ? Both pills alter your core
             preferences; why do you only see one of them as suicide ?

             In addition, I could argue that both pills could be seen as
             life-extending. For example, the anti-art pill could not
             only remove your preference for art, but also fractionally
             increase your preference for physical exercise --- thus
             ensuring that the time you are currently spending on art
             would be spent instead on improving your health. This would
             definitely extend your life, so, why not take the pill ?

                 My point is that there aren't really such things as
                 "core preferences", because we're not unitary
                 consistent agents with well-defined preferences. Our
                 own preferences conflict with each other, and when we
                 discover those conflicts then \*some\* preference has
                 to change if we want to behave rationally.

                 It gets more complicated in that some conflicts are
                 real inconsistencies (I want to eat chips, but I want
                 to not eat chips), some conflicts are just tradeoffs (I
                 want time to appreciate art, but I also want time to
                 exercise, but I don't have unlimited time so I have to
                 optimize), and which is which probably varies from
                 person to person.

                 The desire to (not just the act of) eating lots of
                 sweets is (in the circles most likely under discussion)
                 stigmatized, whereas the reverse is true for art
                 appreciation. Hence the alignment of the second-order
                 desires.

                 (My personal view here is that the origin doesn't have
                 any normative significance in itself; if we like fatty
                 foods because it increased our ancestors' inclusive
                 fitness that's no better or worse a reason to enjoy
                 them than Enkidu so forming us that way. So too for
                 social pressures, at least where third-order desires
                 don't come into play.)

                 Social stigma is an interesting hypothesis, but I don't
                 think it applies in my case. I should have specified
                 that my definition of "art" includes "the Assassin's
                 Creed games", "the best Harry Potter fan fiction", and
                 "singing along to my daughter's Frozen CD in the car".
                 In perhaps all social settings I'd be more comfortable
                 discussing my junk food cravings than all of the above.

                 chips, but I want to not eat chips". It's really more
                 like "Eating chips will give me pleasure now, but pain
                 later". Similarly, when you are deciding whether to
                 read a book or play *Assassin's Creed*, the choice is,
                 "Playing this game will give me pleasure now, but
                 reduced opportunities for pleasure later". The
                 difference is a matter of degree, not of kind.

         One of these things is not like the others... one of these
         things just doesn't belong.

         Taboo "good," "worth," and "wrong."

         If I had the level of technology necessary to engineer a pill
         to reduce my preference for unhealthy foods, I'd much rather
         engineer foods that tasted as good as unhealthy foods while not
         actually harming my health (see, for example, splenda vs sugar
         vs high fructose corn syrup). If that wasn't an option for
         whatever reason, my next choice would be to engineer my body to
         not be harmed by unhealthy foods. My third choice would be to
         engineer my mind to have higher levels of willpower, such that
         I could resist the temptation of eating harmful foods without
         removing the temptation itself. Only as a last resort would I
         remove the desire to eat unhealthy foods, and hopefully that
         would be only a temporary solution while one of the three
         aforementioned solutions came into existence.

         In other words, I terminally value eating french fries, and
         bananas, and fatty pork, and other foods that are not optimal
         for my health. I also terminally value my health. I am willing
         to trade off one against the other if absolutely necessary, but
         my preferred solution would be one which compromised neither
         value.

     On a separate note, am I the only person who does not think that
     hunting-gathering is all that great ?

     I mean, sure, if we assume that everything its proponents are
     saying is true, then switching to a hunting-gathering lifestyle
     will bring us greatly enhanced leisure time and a calmer, more
     relaxed lifestyle in general. That's great.

     Unfortunately, we have to give up some things in exchange. As
     hunter-gatherers, we would (just off the top of my head) never
     reach orbit (to speak nothing of the Moon); never create the
     Internet; and never build an MRI machine. All of these things
     require a massive number of people to dedicate their entire lives
     to a single task; and under a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, you a).
     don't have massive numbers of people, and b). don't have too much
     labor to spare.

         This might be highly contingent on one's (anti-)natalist
         leanings.

         It is interesting to note, too, that the old man -- still the
         "humanist" ["Young
         Marx"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Marx){rel="nofollow"}
         of 1846 -- expressed support for American slavery as an
         unfortunate and temporary necessity in a [private
         letter](https://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1846/letters/46_12_28.htm){rel="nofollow"}.

         Shulamith Firestone likewise suggested that even if the early
         matriarchal order was less anthropological myth and more fact,
         its overthrow by the patriarchy was the right thing in the
         teleological view of the long march towards transhumanism and
         abolishing natural reproduction.

         So yes, serious leftists can get edgy and *\[don't know what
         epithet would fit best\]* as hell at times.

             Yeah, even if agriculture was terribly harmful for a few
             thousand years, it was pretty obviously the right thing to
             do --- you can't get industrialization without agriculture,
             after all.

             Utilitarianism gets *scary* when you factor in future
             humans. (See also: eugenics.)

                 Hence the pro-natalist/anti-natalist axis suddenly
                 becomes directly important. Although it seems like
                 differences between various antinatalisms start
                 mattering a lot too, and, well, I'm definitely not a
                 Sister Y kind of antinalist. I get first-hand what her
                 "View from Hell" -- the understanding that it's
                 impossible for *any* amount of goodness to compensate
                 for *any* suffering, because the metrics are not
                 actually connected and goodness is infinitely ephmereal
                 while suffering is infinitely fundamental -- feels like
                 from the inside, I just... overcame it. I guess as a
                 survivor it feels really necessary for me to bury
                 depression forever and disturb it not.

                 And she's *definitely* a sickeningly creepy Light Side
                 -- flavoured supervillain. I say this in a kind of
                 admiring way. She cultivates this aesthetic where if
                 you're attuned to a certain sensibility, it feels as if
                 she could flay your soul by just sighing in
                 disappointment.

         Yeah, I disagreed really strongly with that section. I like
         being able to read philosophy, travel to China for a week,
         watch television, never worry about starving, and the fact that
         all my children are still alive.

         It is not remotely "easy to see that everyone should be hunter
         gatherers," which is again the problem with a central planner;
         we don't even agree on goals. The central planner Scott
         described seems to think that lotus-eating is the pinnacle of
         human existence. It's not.

             The problem with a central planner is that they're
             drastically less efficient than a generally open market,
             except perhaps on very small scales.

             I hold that the lotus-eater is the pinnacle of human
             existence, but I'm worried about a failure mode of Bad
             Friendly AIs. The scenario is something like this: MIRI or
             some MIRI-like organization certifies some AI as friendly
             and let it loose, and it does stuff that I find greatly
             suboptimal, perhaps worse than having no AI at all, and
             closes off the path to a better AI. It doesn't paperclip
             the universe, but, for example, it preserves the "value" of
             boredom (Yudkowsky thinks it's important to preserve) when
             doing so is actually bad. The MIRI-ists applaud and say
             this is a Friendly AI and that it's doing everything right,
             when it'd be creating the nightmare world\* advocated by
             the [Fun Theory
             Sequence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/){rel="nofollow"},
             in the name of "preserving human values" and "complexity of
             value". Wireheading is good, but I don't expect it to
             wirehead us, and I do expect it to make me considerably
             worse off along some axes.

             \*Perhaps "nightmare world" is an exaggeration, but it
             would be creating a permanently suboptimal world when it
             would have the opportunity to create a much better one.

                 Personally, I worry about a much simpler scenario:
                 Someone invents a new kind of AI that excels at machine
                 translation, or automated cancer research, or what have
                 you; and the MIRI folks shut it down because they think
                 it might, one day, threaten all of mankind in some
                 vaguely ominous way. And now we can't automatically
                 translate text or cure cancer anymore.

         The problem is that given how far our experiences are from the
         lifestyles of hunter gatherers it is extremely hard for us to
         judge how we might feel if we had been raised to consider them
         normal. If someone came up to me and say, "Hey! How would you
         like to be dropped in a rainforest to eat bugs, build huts out
         of sticks and scratch your backside as your guts fill up with
         parasites" I would not be enthusiastic but if I was used to
         such things I might think differently.

         But I'm not heading off to Columbia anytime soon.

     It is *precisely* unpopular ideas -- unpopular not just among one
     group or another, or even a majority, but also with those political
     power -- that that academic freedom was supposed to protect. Your
     argument as it stands can be applied, *mutatis mutandis*, to a
     royalist proclaiming that a professor subject to royal rule has far
     fewer restrictions on his speech than someone subject to a tribal
     warlord would. Both of you are absolutely correct, but I'm afraid
     both these arguments miss the point of what academic freedom
     protects.

     I find that talking about "progressivism" as something that gives
     and takes away freedoms turns it too much into an agent, and that
     muddles thinking. So here's an object-level question: do you think
     it was right of the administration to do the things to "the kind
     Gottfredson lady" that she has outlined? Just to take a random
     instance, do you think it was right to:\
     a) Make her (and only her) course not count towards a sociology
     major,\
     b) Reclassify her research as non-research, purely to retaliate for
     complaining, and\
     c) Lowering her merit ratings?

     Is this sort of behaviour towards people you disagree with right?
     Aren't these officials abusing their power?

     Jumping back to meta: I put quotes around you calling her "the kind
     Gottfredson lady" because I found it
     dismissive/disparaging/demeaning towards her, and wanted to draw
     attention to this but certainly not agree with it. I (and most
     other people here) don't dismiss your lived experience, and I
     really think it would be nice if you'd extend the same courtesy to
     others, too, even those with whom you don't agree.

         > Aren't these officials abusing their power?

         Come on, apply some moldbuggery! All talk of "abusing power" is
         an attempt to legitimize a potential power grab, wrapped in
         *Sklavenmoral*! The more secure the Cathedral gets, the less
         incentive it would have to make those displays of dominance
         frequent and permanently damaging. And that, I claim, is quite
         what her account (and the things some other biodeterminist
         Heretics mention) amounts to.

         NB: I used to speak far more kindly and respectfully of Mrs.
         Gottfredson until further acquainting myself with the content
         of her views and her sociological imagination. So yes, I meant
         to convey that she might be an extraordinarily nice person who
         nontheless has extremely skewed and Problematic perceptions of
         important matters that **do not** directly follow from mere
         biodeterminism. See e.g. the astounding ultra-simplistic
         picture of inequality that simply goes against most intuitions
         and/or disrupts the HBD-ish narrative on *g*.

         (Linking [the
         interview](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2007gottfredsoninterview.pdf){rel="nofollow"}
         again for reference.)

         P.S.:

         Sorry, got lax with reading comprehension. You did mention the
         moldbuggy position, but don't seem to have given it the weight
         that I and some reactionary sympathizers agree it deserves.

         My only exposure to her actual work is through her much-linked
         paper "Why *g* Matters". I started reading the interview, but
         haven't finished it as it's very long. I'll continue reading
         it, but could you in addition tell me what views of hers you
         consider misguided?

         Further, there's a very simple definition of "abusing power"
         that applies to university administrators, because unlike
         monarchs/politicians/civil servants, they're not even
         *supposed* to exercise power, but are mere employees. Using
         institutional position to satisfy your own moral preferences
         when doing so explicitly goes *against* the job function for
         which you're paid is as corrupt as doing it for the
         satisfaction of, say, monetary ends. Further, even assuming
         that security of power and freedom of speech are correlated
         positively, it doesn't seem as if "the Cathedral" is getting
         more secure, as the punitive consequences of expressing the
         "wrong" views seem have increased, not decreased, over the last
         few decades. So either "the Cathedral" is getting less secure,
         or the correlation doesn't apply in this case due to some
         unknown cause (the most plausible being that "the Cathedral" is
         a *religious* and not merely secular schelling point like
         power/money/prestive), or the original argument isn't right.

         My point WRT the "Moldbuggy position" is simply that both yours
         and the (hypothetical) royalist's arguments are wrong, for the
         same reason, in the same way. As I said before, they're
         technically true but miss the point.

         Also, can you please substantiate the idea that Gottfredson is
         attempting to grab power? It certainly doesn't look like that
         to me, and while it's certainly possible (and in politics,
         probably even most likely) that many accusations of "abusing
         power" are simply power grabs dressed up in moral rhetoric,
         it's not applicable to a particular case unless it's shown that
         it was in fact a power grab. As I said, I don't see it -- could
         you show me how it is one? (I don't subscribe to the idea that
         power can never be abused, BTW.)

         And yet you still haven't actually answered my question. Do you
         think what those officials did is right or wrong? Do you think
         they abused their power or not? I'm not asking for how someone
         else's arguments may or may not apply, but for what *you*
         personally think. (For reference, I think that they did. I like
         academic freedom, and I don't care whether it's "the Cathedral"
         or "the Church" or "the State" or "the King" the "the people"
         of really any "the *whatever*" that's violating it.)

         No, no. If we consistently apply moldbuggery, YOU are in this
         moment attempting to stake out a space for your coalition's own
         power grabs by Bravely Resisting Oppression. Moldbug makes a
         fascinating case -- much more intelligent where it is flawed
         than lesser ideas could hope to be where they are plainly
         correct! -- as to why Bravely Resisting Oppression is the worst
         possible act one might commit, and how Oppression might not be
         legitimately harmful in the absense of the possibility for such
         vile rebellion.

         (Of course, most of this is creatively rehashed Hobbes, but
         it's still intellectually appealing.)

     Thank you, Scott, for this post.

     You're one of the very few people I've come across who actually
     address what the other person/side is saying without it devolving
     into a strawman, status-grab, agenda-push, community-build, or some
     other social or individual mode of failure. So even though I
     disagree with some of the examples you used to define Moloch (say,
     about capitalism inherently being a race to the bottom), I still
     find that at worst you're mistaken, not malicious. You further also
     write forward from an honest attempt to understand, not just from a
     caricature or strawman of the other side.

     That's just to say that you don't fail -- which doesn't seem much,
     but in this world full of fail, reading you is like breathing in
     the fresh air. This is a good post, and very well-written. You're
     one of the few blogs I read regularly, and posts like this are a
     big reason why.

     A small point -- given how profitable the humane versions of
     slavery were, I find it criminally tragic that the modern
     abhorrence of systems even resembling slavery prevents even
     completely benign forms of such a system from coming into place in
     places like India, Africa, and China. For instance: I would find
     donating \$100 or \$200 a month only a very small hit to my income,
     but it would pay for the food, lodging, and education of an
     impoverished child in India. (I pick India because that's where I'm
     from, and because I know there are probably many high-IQ,
     high-potential children in poverty there, and because I know how
     much money is needed for food, lodging, and education.) If I could
     collect, say, 10% of that child's income (above some defined
     threshold) after he becomes an adult (with him retaining the option
     of buying his way out by paying some pre-defined lump sum), it
     would be a win-win investment resulting in a modest profit for me
     and a very high quality-of-life increase for the child and
     subsequent adult. But the unenforceability of such contracts means
     that I (and millions of others like me) lose a *heartwarming* way
     of making money, and millions of children live in poverty and are
     denied opportunities. And there isn't even any actual slavery
     involved.

         The Saudis would choke with greed and die upon hearing that the
         Late Roman laws on slave status and slave treatment were to be
         applied to their "guest" workers. Nah, (anti-)slavery
         legislation and related exercise of force seem to do any good
         in the more progressive direction only; Roman and Arab slave
         codes were a nice tech to pick up, sure, and yet I can't think
         of a single example in history where the formalization of
         slavery in the *more* pro-exploitation direction led to
         reigning in unlegislated violence towards slaves, rather than
         simply increased exploitation and a race to the bottom against
         other kinds of labour.

             I mentioned completely benign because that's what I meant
             -- there is very little need for personal authority,
             geographic proximity, or personal interaction in the system
             I thought of. Perhaps I wasn't clear -- there is no actual
             "slavery" in what I'm talking about. So no Roman slave
             codes, no Arab slave tech. It's closer to profitable
             charity than anything else, given how disproportionate the
             impacts on the two people are. I make a small profit, but
             some person (who it isn't necessary for me to meet or even
             really know at all) has his life completely turned around.

             Here's how I can imagine it working: an institution in
             India to which I give money, which uses it to educate a
             child, a percentage of whose adult income over a threshold
             is given to me. The adult retains the right to buy his way
             out of having to pay this percentage by paying a
             pre-specified sum, but if he doesn't, that percentage of
             his income is all the claim I have on him. I give him
             nothing other than what I do, and cannot claim/get anything
             else in return, nor do I have any authority over him.
             (Authority when a child is strictly limited, and exercised
             not by me personally but by the institution.) Because the
             institution pools risk over multiple investors and multiple
             children, my individual risk is significantly lowered.
             Millions of bright kids get an education, I make a modest
             profit, everyone is better off. (This, BTW, isn't just (or
             even primarily) for children who are destitute, orphans, or
             in some other way alone; it's perfectly applicable to
             children from functioning families, too many of which
             simply don't have the means to afford an education, and
             would happily take this deal, knowing that it'd leave all
             of them significantly better off. I can't see the
             downside.)

             But because this (completely benign) contract isn't
             enforceable, none of this happens.

                 This is a bit like what European serfdom evolved into.
                 Yet even in the modern world this is completely legal,
                 relatively uncontroversial and widely practiced -- by
                 governments. You might pattern-match this to the
                 infamous US student loan industry -- but many other
                 counterparts exist around the world, including the more
                 "slavery"-like such as the whole
                 US-military-as-an-institute-of-social-mobility thing.
                 On the more authoritarian end, the GDR was particularly
                 infamous even within the Eastern Bloc for aggressively
                 steering and routing its young people's education and
                 careers beginning at high school level; I don't recall
                 whether Singapore has something like it. Now the
                 problem is reduced to making it transnational,
                 for-profit and NGO-based. ...And this is where I would
                 agree and lean libertarian, with the expected caveats
                 about Molochean
                 corporate-corruption-that-is-also-regulatory-capture.

                 You don't seem to be proposing any Proper Good Old
                 Things that burn and bite our vile kind so, such as
                 [personalized and intimate client-patron

                 that Prof. Robin characterizes as essential to the
                 rightist jouissance of domination. I have no

                 The U.S. student loan system has an option available to
                 anybody (with certain categories of loans) that limits
                 their payments to a percentage of their income (called
                 the income-contingent repayment plan ... not to be
                 confused with the income-based repayment plan, which
                 requires extenuating circumstances), at the cost of
                 extending the repayment period from 10 years to up to
                 25 (which includes paying a larger total amount,
                 because of interest ... unless you still haven't paid
                 it off after 25 years, in which case the balance is
                 forgiven!).

                 This is not that far from F&C's proposal. By putting a
                 cap on the monthly remittance and a time limit on the
                 whole deal, the proposal could be restructured as an
                 interest-bearing loan with an income-contingent
                 repayment plan and the possibility of income-contingent
                 forgiveness, making it enforceable (unless perhaps the
                 effective interest rate would be illegally high?).

         If you want to be altruistic, just donate the money for zero
         return. If you want to status-grab while actually profiting by
         putting people in perpetual debt peonage to yourself, go do it
         somewhere less gullible.

             A constant return in a fixed time period compounds to
             become an exponentially increasing amount after a series of
             time periods. Wanting your altruism to be able to grow
             exponentially is not "status grabbing".

             I don't know how Haidt concluded that "liberal" morality
             lacks a Purity/Sanctity axis. You just need to test for
             perceived-impurities like "profit" rather than
             "homosexuality".

             You're not actually an anarchist trying to parody the
             left-wing, are you? If you really equate "10% of income
             above some threshold" and "perpetual debt peonage", you've
             basically written off every government on the planet as
             slavers.

         I seem to remember Thomas Sowell making a point like this about
         indentured servitude in one of his books. Letting Irish people
         work as near-slaves for their first few years in the US to pay
         back their travel debts looked too much like a step on a
         slippery slope to slavery, so it was banned, so during the
         famines anyone who couldn't afford the travel out of pocket and
         didn't have any collateral better than their own freedom got to
         starve instead.

         I can't find any references to this argument, though, and it's
         been decades since I read it, so my apologies to Dr. Sowell if
         I'm misquoting him and to everyone here if I'm misstating
         history.

         Your suggestion's attributes (freedom to choose work, payment
         for longer term but at a lower rate) seem to be less prone to
         abuse than indentured servitude was, but that might be a
         failure of evil creativity on my part.

     Am I the only one who would look forward to this? Look,
     sentimentally and aesthetically, I value humanity and a glorious
     future as much as anyone else, but I can't escape the conclusion
     that creating morally salient beings is almost always a losing
     proposition.\
     Can you wrong a nonexistent person by not bringing them into
     existence? I don't see how that's possible. Yet, I think many, if
     not most of the people here would agree that there are some beings
     whose suffering is so great that they would be better off dead. Why
     bring sentient beings into existence at all if it's at best neutral
     and at least occasionally negative?\
     Sure, humans typically value the creation of beings similar to
     ourselves, and we should take these desires into account. Yet how
     much should we weigh the wants of present and past generations
     against the boundless future? If we face even a possibility of the
     Hansonian nightmare, with an exponentially expanding population of
     miserable drudges, then death by Paper Clipper or gray goo swarm
     may be a mercy.\
     I admit, there are some possible futures where creating sentient
     life would break even, futures where Elua satisfies absolutely
     everything's values forever. But a stable singleton that well
     calibrated for human well-being, let alone the well-being of all
     other life on this planet sophisticated enough to feel pain? That's
     an awfully difficult target, and our flawed attempts to hit it may
     just lead to billions of years of continued suffering.

     Having Moloch burn out the last traces of sentience may the best we
     can reasonably hope for.

     Scott, I will respond later when I'm not quite so filled with rage
     at you for completely ignoring the entire history of left-wing
     political thought. Or perhaps just being ignorant of it.

     Suffice to say: did you know Moloch is actually strongest in the
     United States of America and in China compared to almost any place
     else on Earth? And now even the Americans and Chinese are turning
     on him.

     Unfriendly AIs, yes, we should be afraid of those. But deifying the
     pathetic, small, sick and stupid piece of shite that is
     American-style neoliberal capitalism, while ignoring the vast and
     growing territories held by, as you call It, Elua?

     Get out.

         Nope. This is where I would disagree and insist that you HMC.
         The situation appears very grim if you see the technological
         and political trends of the last two decades is connected.
         Neoliberalism is probably transitioning from a locally-corrupt,
         democracy-exploiting strategy of political and administrative
         opportunism to an alliance with the revolution in the mode of
         production.

         Things are indeed looking good for China and some others... in
         the short term... but what about the destruction of the
         American middle class?... the growing desperation of First
         World labour aristocracy (as featured many times in the very
         comments on this blog!)... the possible disruption of Africa
         and SE Asia's ascension to China's old "global workshop" tier
         as robots replace the global slave class ... Europe's
         stagnation and disfunctionality... the fairly unpleasant and
         unpromising detours of Bolivarianism... the whole of Middle
         East and Central Asia, and the many ways things could get worse
         if the grasp of the US either weakens further or tries to
         reassert itself...

         Hell, for just one telling example, consider what the Wicked
         Witch of the West said in the ending of The Wizard of Oz: *"New
         Labour is my greatest achievement! Mwahahaha!"* Have we seen
         anything that would prove her wrong, either locally or wrt the
         West's political transformation in general?

         (I'm not going to talk about the fortunes of my country, as
         it's my grandma's birthday today and I don't want to show up
         piss-drunk, which would be the immediate result of any
         contemplation now.)

         In the past Scott has demonstrated both total ignorance of the
         history of left-wing thought and a willingness to learn more,
         possibly contingent upon a lot of time falling down from the
         sky on him (which is understandable.)

         I literally burst out laughing at this. People are looking at
         me funny now.

         Listen, have you seen any politics recently? I assure you, very
         little territory is held by Elua.(And the US is ... actually
         better off than most of the world -- hence the term "first
         world country." Depressing, huh?)

         As Scott said, Elua has currently bound more of Moloch than
         ever before -- with democracy, capitalism, and technology. But
         that isn't the same as having much power of her own; Moloch is
         the strong one, and the instant his bonds loosen, he will be
         free. Already, she can only lightly steer his actions; many of
         them are to his benefit, not hers.

             Yeah, and then these so-called worshipers of Elua keep
             sacrificing *our* babies to gain power, and screaming about
             how they wish they could throw *all* of us into the

                 Protip: If ANY babies have to be sacrificed, *that's
                 not Elua, that's Moloch.*

                 And whenever you find yourself in a position where "we
                 have to sacrifice these few babies so that these other
                 babies can survive", Moloch has won.

                 Moloch wins *a lot*.

                 I believe Wes is counting fertility suppression as
                 child sacrifice here, so really anything other than
                 tiling the universe with babies is an instance of the
                 bloodstained altar.

                 (Poor Moloch! He can't be appeased with a mere 99.999%
                 of the universe being tiled with nonbaby.)

         You've identified that there's a large inferential distance
         here, so why do you think your scorn will be convincing? I look
         forward to tie actual arguments, because if all you have is
         laughter and anger then I'm inclined to think that "entire
         history of left-wing political thought" is, uh bollocks.

     Interesting theological note towards the end about Moloch that
     strikes rather well with a collection by a Dominican Friar I've
     been reading on and off ('God Matters' by Herbert McCabe, which
     everyone should read); McCabe argues, coming from a Christian
     perspective, that the history of the One True Religion is the
     history of God (big G) freeing us from our self-created bonds to
     the gods (little g), to the literal and metaphorical 'gods of this
     earth.'\
     In John's Gospel he is called 'The Prince of the World,' but we
     might as well call him HRH Prince Gnon. (as point of fact, the
     source of the acronym is 'God of Nature, or (more simply) Nature').

     This is the best thing I've read all month.

     If it were just another essay on the choices that competition will
     force us to make... well, it still would have been pretty good. But
     having it compared to Ginsberg, who I had never read before and, at
     a first pass, thought was creepy but incomprehensible, and then
     having that explained?

     This is a lesson that will stick with me.

     Some parts were interesting, but your central point is wrong.
     Competition and optimization won't necessarily kill those values.
     The capacity to care about those values only developed as a result
     of competition and optimization between humans and human groups.
     The only goal is differential reproductive success, and economic
     success is only a proxy for that.

     The malthusian past didn't destroy those values, why should the
     malthusian future? And for fuck sakes, dispense with the stupid
     names for the Gods, it makes the essay harder to understand, and
     leaves the impression that you're saying something profound when
     it's completely banal.

     It strikes me that Moloch could be considered as system 2 and Elua
     system 1. I don't think Moloch is necessarily evil.
     Self-improvements of all sorts require sacrifice. Is there any
     distinction that lets us endorse those sacrifices while rejecting
     Moloch? Or does worship of Elua require that self-improvement be
     abandoned and that you live in the moment forever?

     The wonderfully deep and thought-provoking ideas of this post mesh
     very well with those of the Thrive-Survive Theory of Politics post.
     (When Scott has some time, he should write a book elaborating all
     these ideas in a coherent whole and exposing them in a way people
     outside the LW-sphere can understand!)

     My meaning: rightists are generically those who feel the hot breath
     of Moloch at their backs, and are willing and eager to sacrifice
     portions of Elua to Moloch in order to placate him and let other
     parts of Elua (hopefully) survive. For example, compassion for the
     needy at the social level must be eliminated, or its incentives
     will create an army of state-fed beggars that destroys civilization
     itself.

     Leftists feel secure in our age of large excess resources and see
     no need to sacrifice compassion, sexual freedom, anti-militarism,
     and other components of (their) Elua. The more naive leftists have
     forgotten Moloch so completely that they do not even comprehend the
     philosophical basis of rightism, attributing it only to greed and
     hatred. The mature leftist position is to bring to full light the
     phantasm Molochs that the rightist fears, and expose them as
     (mostly) relics of the past we need not fear in a modern age of
     technological plenty; the Molochs that we should fear most instead,
     like runaway nanotech and UFAI, are entirely novel and not
     controllable by rightist politics. (Other milder Molochs we face,
     like environmental damage or exploitive capitalism, are controlled
     by exactly the opposite to rightist policies).

         I used "leftists" meaning generically those on the Thrive side

             Thanks, though I'm not an ancap, just a libertarian, and
             not even a hardcore one at that.

             Though this reminds me of how my left-libertarian friends
             say that Communism is to the right of libertarianism. I
             think there's a grain of truth to that. Left-right and
             thrive-survive don't align easily. Thrive-survive is more
             like pro-tech/rationalist progressives and culturally
             liberal libertarians at one end and Stalinists, theocrats,
             and reactionaries at the other end.

             Leninists of most sorts combine "it is necessary to be
             disciplined and make sacrifices for the future" with
             hostility towards ascribed status, hence why they're poorly
             handled and not merely on its "right."

             (I agree that many libertarians are Thrive.)

             The majority of radical leftists (not radical leftist
             \*theorists\* specifically) throughout the last couple

             Orwell started out as basically a vulgar class tourist.

             (If Orwell was locked into a room with Sam Francis and

                 unconsciously selected because it has signalling value,
                 not because the guy was *that* particularly terrible.

             I agree wholeheartedly with the plan of handing over
             political power to those who have lived in banlieues. Some
             Type I errors, like Mr. Francis, are a perfectly acceptable
             price to pay.

             to having lived under it, &c.)

     This is certainly the best writing I've ever seen outside of print,
     and that includes HPMOR. I firmly intend to buy any book you ever
     write.

     Due to sheer awe, I find myself temporarily unable to respond with
     anything but praise. Once this subsides, I shall attempt to help
     adress the issues you are raising.

     What I do after a long and *excellent* post like this is mull over
     it for a little while. Of course the result of this is that I am
     coming in after over 500 other comments, so nobody will read this.

     Nonetheless: what you really need to wonder is whether God is
     Moloch or Elua. Because if God is Moloch, you're *screwed*. Your
     FAI project will fail. Your resources will run out. Your children
     will disavow your. Your values will perish. There is no way out.

     How about some mystical theology?

     > Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the
     > earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was
     > only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made
     > man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. So the Lord

     > air, for I am sorry that I have made them." But Noah found grace
     > in the eyes of the Lord.

     When your memetics get sufficiently perverse, God is not above a
     hard reset and starting over from better stock.

     > And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower
     > whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves,
     > lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."

     You cannot beat God with your technology. There is always a way to
     undermine you, and God will find it.

     Both of the above are compatible with both Moloch and Elua. The
     point is that whatever Gnon wants, Gnon gets, without exception.
     You may persist for a little while in defiance of his purposes, but
     judgement always comes. And this is why I cannot endorse the
     transhumanist project: because it is *doomed to fail*. God is Gnon
     is God, and there is no way out, no way to get above him, no way to
     tear him down from heaven.

     You just had better hope that Gnon is Elua and not Moloch.

         This seems to be committing the fallacy I've (almost certainly
         re-)discovered; someone here probably knows the real name, but
         I might call it the 'fatalist fallacy'. It goes like this:

         You reason that all of your actions and fate are predetermined
         by your genes and your environment, therefore you can't change
         your fate by willing things, therefore you might as well stop
         willing things. You do so, and you sit there until you starve
         to death.

         Essentially the fallacy is taking a view of the system that
         correctly excludes outside agency and then failing to consider
         that your decisions might be inside agency.

         In this case, what's to say the transhumanist movement isn't
         the hand of Elua? As I read it, your argument applies equally
         well to anyone in history hoping to improve coordination, and
         we know lots of them succeeded.

         This is one of a hundred little bits of the Bible that convince
         me that the Christian God, if He exists, is not worthy of
         obedience, let alone adoration, and should be overthrown at the
         earliest opportunity.

                 Was Tower of Babel going to have consequences equal to
                 a UFAI? Or did God break His children into a hundred
                 different factions for shits 'n giggles? Or to protect
                 His own position?

                 Allowing a species, group, or individual with corrupt
                 values to achieve omnipotence ("now nothing that they
                 propose to do will be withheld from them") is generally
                 considered a bad idea. Hence, UFAI.

                 So why let God keep His omnipotence? Which, in
                 practice, means letting whatever monkey has the miter
                 that proclaims him the Voice of God this week rule the
                 roost.\
                 Either we get past natural limits -- maybe harvest
                 resources from other universes to get around entropy or
                 something -- or we die trying. It's not like wer'e
                 going to get out alive, and Heaven and Hell
                 (particularly Hell) are nothing but sick little lies
                 from the old wormy books.

                 Like I said, you'd better hope that God is Elua and not
                 Moloch.

             You quote the Bible at me; precisely what am I supposed to
             get out of a questionable translation of some ancient
             shaman's mushroom-trip, that somehow along with a bunch of
             other folktales and legends ended up on top of the memetic
             dogpile?\
             I'm certain that the Christian God, if He exists, is closer
             to Moloch than Elua -- things like the genocide of the
             Canaanites at the hands of his "Chosen People" leave me
             with no doubt there, leaving the Book of Job looking like a
             little boy pulling wings off flies by comparison. This post
             is about *dragging him off his throne and killing him.* And
             building our own Elua/Buddha to put in his place.\
             You say God can't be overthrown, can't be deposed -- the
             *same stupid argument* made about every
             idiot/sadistic/corrupt dictator in history, right up until
             the moment they were defeated in battle, or stabbed in the
             back, or dragged to a guillotine and made a foot shorter.
             If you were living under a Fnargl with the personality of a
             Qaddafi or a Saddam Hussein or Pol Pot or Hitler, would you
             bow down with a "Can't overthrow him, might as well live
             with it?" Or would you try anyway? You've argued we're
             going to fail and die *anyway*, what do we have to lose by
             trying to change that?\
             Congratulations, Mai, you have with your arguments made me
             *more* of a supporter of MIRI and the quest for a Friendly
             AI that I was an hour ago. Good job.

                 You have the fundamentalist's twin diseases of
                 literality and moral condemnation. I was sorely tempted
                 to just quote
                 [this](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A10-13&version=NKJV){rel="nofollow"},
                 but I have relented and will speak plainly.

                 I offered the stories of the Great Flood and the Tower
                 of Babel as parables of the fact that God/Gnon/Moloch
                 is *really, really* hard to beat, as you are quite
                 literally playing by his rules, in his court, and under
                 his supervision. Your memes get too out of whack and
                 WHAM your entire civilization gets destroyed. It
                 *probably* won't literally be because the waters of the
                 firmament pour down and cover the entire face of the
                 earth, but it's entirely possible that your destruction
                 will be just as sudden and just as astounding as if
                 they had. The Tower of Babel suggests the same thing
                 about technological projects.

                 Can you fight this? Yes. Can you get incrementally
                 higher, bigger, better? Yes. Can you build a tower to
                 heaven, bind Moloch in a tomb beneath the earth, and
                 lift Elua to godhood? Um. There are a bunch of reasons
                 why I think you cannot. (With regards to the
                 transhumanist FAI project in particular, I do not think
                 that intelligence can be increased indefinitely, and
                 I'm quite sure that there are no sources of free
                 infinite energy, and pretty much all descriptions of
                 the post-singularity FAI that I have read covertly
                 assume infinite intelligence and infinite energy, which
                 makes them all fantasy.)

                 Allow me to quote something which is *not* the Bible:

                 > Let there be a little country without many people.\
                 > Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a
                 > hundred,\
                 > and never use them.\
                 > Let them be mindful of death\
                 > and disinclined to long journeys.\
                 > They'd have ships and carriages,\
                 > but no place to go.\
                 > They'd have armor and weapons,\
                 > but no parades.\
                 > Instead of writing,\
                 > they might go back to using knotted cords.\
                 > They'd enjoy eating,\
                 > take pleasure in clothes,\
                 > be happy with their houses,\
                 > devoted to their customs.
                 >
                 > The next little country might be so close\
                 > the people could hear the cocks crowing\
                 > and dogs barking there,\

     The libertarians I read tend to teach law or economics, so it's
     very surreal to me to see you characterizing Libertarians as being
     *less* likely than average to get externalities and have a theory
     for dealing with them. Are there major Libertarian voices who
     actually don't understand Pigovian taxes?

         A division of libertarianism that I just made up is libertarian
         economists vs. libertarian politicians. The thing that
         politicians push is always somewhat different from what
         academics take seriously. Proposing taxes -- even taxes on bad
         stuff -- would contradict the highly-salable political message
         of government as bad, taxes as bad. Consistency on the
         deontological level pushing out consistency on the
         consequentialist level, in order to better sell the message.

     Ialdabaoth, I feel an unrelenting need to contact you and discuss
     some things, which on my end are going to be very private and in
     long-form. Based on some of your previous comments here and the
     specific intersection of interests/obsessions you've displayed, I
     conclude that you're likely to be the most sympathetic ear for what
     troubles me specifically. Input on your part would be largely
     optional. We would establish the particulars in private. We'd also
     figure out a way for me to recompense you.

     If you're curious, please leave a mail address of some sort here!

     Some scattered thoughts on this post, which I really enjoyed.

     One idea Scott just touches on is what happens when incentives get
     out of whack. People will do whatever they're incentivized to do,
     and how to incentivize them appropriately is a field of active
     economics research.

     I don't see how a monarchy of some sort solves the coordination
     problem (I'm not sure this is something Scott is saying, but I
     think he is). Getting everyone to follow a monarch so that ze can
     solve everyone's coordination problem is itself a coordination
     problem. Real-life monarchs and equivalents -- dictators,
     presidents-for-life, etc. -- spend a lot of time maintaining a
     power base of the most powerful people in the society they rule.
     This group has to coordinate to keep all the members happy,
     including keeping the monarch in charge. Each of the powerful
     people in society each has their power base of
     slightly-less-powerful people that has a similar dynamic. And so on
     -- it's turtles all the way down.

     Scott, I enjoyed this essay wholeheartedly. I was all like, "fuck
     yeah!" Then I read the comments, and remembered that you are a
     MIRI-ist, and was totally disappointed.

     It drives me batty that there are a set of people who see the
     problem, but, rather than work to solve it, are throwing their time
     and energy away on a fairy tale of AI. 🙁

         Um, the entire end of the article is about creating a

         Also, I can see your email address and it suggests you might be

             ::: comment-body
             2nd part first; I'm relatively nearby. I have not attended
             Michigan meetups, but I would like to, someday. Scheduling
             sucks, because reasons, but I pay attention. Hopefully I'll
             get out to one some day.

             1st part second: Something that coordinates the lives of
             individuals is a third order organism\*, like a pack,
             tribe, government or corporation. Such a being need not be
             intelligent. Third order life already exists, it's just not
             very good at controlling its component individuals. It's
             only a matter of time before individuals become strongly
             bound inside a third order life form, and unable to leave,
             same as your liver cells can't defect from your body. (Bad
             analogy. I am a programmer, not a doctor.)

             I'm very skeptical about "foom" arguments, and I expect
             strong AI to be 200-1000 years away, not 40-100, which
             calls for a different timescale. We have time to wait on
             AI, but \_right now\_ we need Friendly corporations,
             governments, cities and tribes. I expect AI to be a slow,
             evolutionary process, and "weak" AIs to be used in the
             service of third order life effectively to control their
             component individuals long before the AI is as smart as a
             pigeon, let alone superintelligent.

             We're in crunch time because right now we're smarter than
             the existing third order life. Third order life
             friendliness is way more important than AI (while
             potentially also improving life incrementally as its
             adopted.)

             The underlying problem is a world ruled by Moloch, but Elua
             will be a properly functioning government, not an AI.
             Sadly, I do not have a MIRI to point to to collect
             donations. (MaydayPAC, maybe? Not sure.)

             tl;dr: Don't waste money on AI, waste it on fixing society.

             (I seem to come to very different conclusions than other
             people; (See also my ideas on social justice. (You can't
             see them, as I have not managed to successfully communicate
             them to the few people who will still talk to me about
             that, let alone to strangers. Sorry)) I'm not sure if I'm
             crazy like a fox, or just crazy.)

             \*First order life is single celled. Second order life is
             multicellular; Third order life is multi-individual ---
             societies, families, companies.

                 No, that's pretty much my conclusion as well; I'm just
                 focused on silicon-based distributed systems right now
                 because they're so much more tractable than the
                 protein-based ones. (Decidable problems are priceless;
                 for everything else there's heuristics, and when those
                 inevitably fail, there's Mastercard.)

                 I pay a lot of attention to the protein-based kind,
                 though, especially how they fail.

                 \@no one special: I'm not sure there is one, although I
                 run into proto-tribes along these lines occasionally.
                 The one I like best is notionally based in Germany, but
                 its nodes move around a lot. For that one in
                 particular, I suspect its strong preference against
                 strongly binding second-order life forms has a lot to
                 do with the fact that it woke up in East Berlin, but it
                 probably also has quite a lot to do with the fact that
                 the second-order life forms involved are all
                 particularly focused on the minutiae of systems and how
                 their interoperation fails as they grow more complex.

                 Most of the people I encounter with this mindset
                 satisfy both (is-a 'hacker) and (grew-up-in
                 'eastern-bloc), though not all.

                 \@Meredith: Memo to self; Meet more German Hackers.

                 I suspect that binding of humans will be accomplished
                 more by epistemic closure (the political one) than by
                 physical location. The Internet is already more real
                 than meatspace, now that everyone is on facebook.

                 I'm left in this odd circumstance of hanging out with
                 the LW-crowd, who seem to think right, but have come to
                 a pants-on-head-crazy conclusion\* or hanging out with
                 people who don't even really know what evidence is. I'd
                 really like a group that knows how to think, and shares
                 my values so that I don't have to reinvent politics and
                 ethics from scratch. I'm just waiting for someone to
                 say, "that sounds a lot like the philosophy of \_foo\_,
                 you should check him out." Instead they round me off to
                 the nearest stereotype and start arguing against a
                 strawman.

                 \* Oh god, the headpants. The fact that lesswrong and
                 CFAR are backed by MIRI-folks makes everything they do
                 so suspicious. It's like being offered a free
                 psychological screening by the Scientologists. Is
                 Bayesian reasoning \_really\_ better than naive
                 reasoning, or is it just more likely to make you agree
                 with MIRI? Teeth-grindingly frustrating.

             involving prediction markets, ordinary supercomputers and a
             mathematically rigorous definition of "good"...

             I'm pretty sceptical of prediction markets, and even more
             of absolute monarchs, but in general designing a government
             Moloch can't take over seems like a problem worth trying.
             Sort of like how second-price auctions remove a whole

     On deicide and comparative religion.

     Atheists often see the God they disbelieve in as a finite
     superbeing; some even fantasise about deicide.

     This is not the God of any remotely sophisticated kind of
     monoheism...in fact the idea of gods as humans writ large is more
     characteristic of polytheism.

     "Monotheism's God isn't like one of the Greek gods, except that he
     happens to have no god friends. It's an utterly different kind of
     concept." (Oliver Burkeman in his review of David Bentley Hart's
     The Experience of God,
     [http://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/jan/14/the-theology-book-atheists-should-read](http://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/jan/14/the-theology-book-atheists-should-read){rel="nofollow ugc"})

     As Hart writes:-"...according to the classical metaphysical
     traditions of both the East and West, God is the unconditioned
     cause of reality -- of absolutely everything that is -- from the
     beginning to the end of time. Understood in this way, one can't
     even say that God "exists" in the sense that my car or Mount
     Everest or electrons exist. God is what grounds the existence of
     every contingent thing, making it possible, sustaining it through
     time, unifying it, giving it actuality. God is the condition of the
     possibility of anything existing at all."

     How could you commit deicide against the philosophers God, the
     Ground of Being? That would be like the chara

     cters in a novel killing the author. Indeed, even if the Author's
     characters rebel against Him, that is his decision.

     "And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away from guidance,
     as they refused to believe therein for the first trespass to wander
     blindly." \[Al-Qur'an 6:110\]".

     " Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will.
     He is the Mighty, the Wise. \[14:4\]"

     This theologcal principle finds full flower in the Hindu doctrine
     of Lila , or Divine Play.

         Scott was only being poetic. For more than one reason, he does
         not literally believe God can be killed.

         I think you're doing polytheism a disservice here. From a
         modern perspective, we see (e.g.) the Greek gods mostly in the
         context of poetry and folktales, and so we imagine that they
         were understood as we understand the characters in those
         stories --- when scenes like e.g. the Judgment of Paris were
         actually about as relevant to the *content* of Classical
         religion as the scene of God and the Satan bickering over Job's
         faith is to Judaism or Christianity.

         Classical esotericism got quite sophisticated.

         Greek gods didn't look much like "greek gods" either.

         Hinduism is illustrative here, since it's pretty much the only
         old-style indo-european pagan religion left; while you can make
         a "finite human-like entities having zany adventures" story out
         of the myths if you really want to, talking to a guru or
         theologian for more than five seconds will disabuse you of the
         notion. The stories are colorful because they are supposed to
         be memorable, and their symbolism is not that hard to decode
         with a little cultural context.

         You'll notice that when Traditional texts get translated into
         English the Father/King deity (*Zeus\[and sometimes
         Apollo/Cronos\]/Jupiter, Odin/Wotan, Krishna, Ahura Mazda*)
         always ends up rendered as God in the singular. This is not a
         mistake or instance of cultural imperialism, as these peoples
         viewed the chief regal diety as the central point from which
         the other gods/divine forces (*Numina in the Latin*) spring.
         The other lesser divinities were called on for intercessions in
         specific circumstances like Christian saints but only the
         paternal God presided over all activities. Judaism's main
         innovation was to cut themselves off from identifying Jehovah
         with the Gods of their hated neighbors, not any substantive
         difference in his power or authority relative to the others.

         Reading Greek mythology without an understanding of symbolism
         is just as illiterate as looking at the two creation stories in
         Genesis and deciding that dinosaurs couldn't have existed
         because God didn't set aside a day for velociraptors. It takes
         an almost willful obtuseness to ignore any meaning but the most
         crudely physical in a work explicitly describing the
         metaphysical

             This assertion did not comport with my memory of reading
             viking literature when I was younger, and a brief search on
             the Internet indicates that it is incorrect at least
             regarding Odin.

                 The Eddas aren't true primary sources on Norse
                 religion. They're thought to be accurate in broad
                 strokes as regards the folktales and beliefs of the
                 pre-Christian Norse; but the Younger Edda, and the
                 oldest known sources for the Elder, were both written
                 in the 13th century, after Christianization, and by
                 Christians. The traces of this are pretty obvious: for
                 example, Snorri Sturluson in his prologue to the
                 *Younger Edda* goes on a long digression about how the
                 stories he's writing down aren't *really* about gods,
                 as might be guessed from the content, but rather
                 ancient chieftains that acquired a divine following
                 over the years. It's to be expected that the capital-G
                 "God" wouldn't be used by their authors: that namespace
                 is occupied.

                 This is a persistent problem in the analysis of
                 pre-Christian North European religion. Even in the
                 cases where we have substantial sources of close to the
                 right age (often we don't), they've almost without
                 exception suffered from Christian interpolation or
                 rationalization at some point, and it can be quite
                 difficult to figure out what's original. There's even
                 some debate over whether some rather famous figures
                 existed in the original myths or were interpreted in
                 similar ways; Balder for example looks suspiciously
                 Christlike in places. (Not that the dying-and-rising
                 God is all that uncommon in Indo-European myths.)

             I'm not sure who this rant is aimed against. The
             Burkeman/Hart argument is that atheists are strawmamming
             monotheism by seeing it through polytheistic glasses. That
             they are gettinng polytheism wrong too only buttresses the
             point.

             Also, it's not difficult to see why they are metaphor
             blind. They read of sci .fi, and sci .fi is essentially
             larger than life but finite entities having amazing
             adventures..taken literally. The point is not "what do the
             six arms mean" , but "six arms! Awesome!"

                 It's not directed at you, not really, it's just that
                 there's a specific kind of dismissal which is empowered
                 by this sort of mythological obtuseness.

                 For example, let's say you read the Bhagavad Gita and
                 it says 'I \[Krishna\] am the source of all things, and
                 all things emerge from me; knowing this, wise men
                 worship by entering my state of being."

                 To really understand this concept, that there is a
                 central originating force in the cosmos which men can
                 emulate, and then to put it into practice is arguably
                 the ultimate achievement of Yogic wisdom. The language
                 challenges you, like Arjuna, to allow Krishna to steer
                 you onto the path to victory by first conquering
                 yourself. To understand the essence of millennia of
                 hard-earned knowledge, common to stoics yogis monks and
                 hundreds of other traditions all across Eurasia.

                 Or you can giggle, say "what, everything comes from the
                 big spooky guy covered with mouths?" and go back to
                 wallowing in your own weakness and ignorance.

                 It's not as if most of those people were about to leap
                 at the call to transcendence anyway, but it's certainly
                 an unnecessary additional barrier.

                 I agree that there is massive miscommunication, but it
                 is not all on one side. I don't think you can blame
                 anyone for being confused by Rowan Williams style
                 metaphor-piled-on-metaphor. Typical religious leaders
                 can't cash out the metaphors because they are
                 bureaucrats and community leaders, not philosophers or
                 mystics.

                 Yes, though one of the benefits of that sort of layered
                 allegory is that different people can engage it on
                 their own levels of understanding.

                 Even in the clergy not everyone needs to be a
                 theologian; after all, the same applies in the lay
                 sciences as well or else it would be impossible to
                 change your oil without a half-dozen doctorates to your
                 name. As long as ordinary people can engage the symbols
                 on even the most basic level they can at least take
                 away enough to participate.

     Starting from VIII I was mentally cheering. Yes! Yes! The Culture
     is the alternative and I'm seeing someone else come to that
     conclusion without referencing The Culture and all of its strongly
     god-like artificial intelligences!

     This is going to be an essay I come back to when discussing these
     topics in the future.

     I, for one, welcome our new gardener the Mind of the General
     Systems Vehicle *Sense amid Madness, Wit amidst Folly*.

         I personally don't have this unrestrained enthusiasm for the
         Culture that other people seem to exhibit. As far as I see it,
         in the Culture, humans (and other similar beings) essentially
         live out their lives as pets of the Minds. They are fed,
         housed, generally cared for and cherished; but they have
         absolutely no control over anything that really matters, and
         their lives have been stagnant for countless millennia.

         This isn't necessarily a bad thing, mind you; it's quite likely
         that humans simply can't be trusted with anything important,
         and simply lack the capacity for self-improvement beyound a
         certain point. Still, it is at least a little sad.

             Certainly there is *some* reason beyond the unpleasantness
             of it to have Special Circumstances operate as human-drone
             pairs, rather than just make perfect simulacra with the
             personality of a drone, the destructive capability of an
             E-Dust terror weapon and uplink to a Mind lurking in orbit.
             *Consider Phlebas* also briefly mentions the extremely rare
             not!psychic unaugmented humans who can be used to predict
             the future by sheer luck.

             Edit: heh, The Culture is probably the only universe where
             "the personality of a drone" means "independent and
             inquisitive".

                 AFAIK, such a reason was never given.

                 When the Culture representatives come to your world,
                 always remember: you're not really talking to the
                 human. You're talking to that knife missile hovering
                 right above her shoulder.

                 > Consider Phlebas also briefly mentions the extremely
                 > rare not!psychic unaugmented humans...

                 Since they were never mentioned again, I don't think
                 they should count as canon, given how little sense the
                 whole idea makes.

             What control do we have now over the things that really
             matter? Either a small number of humans at the top have it,
             in which case they might as well be minds as far as the
             rest of us are concerned. Or it's something that emerges
             like Moloch from the sum of all our individual behaviours,
             in which case, again, might as well be Minds. Or we have
             some diffuse fractional democratic amount of it, in which
             case we could just as well have that under a culture-like
             system. (Have you been following *To The Stars* ?)

             What is this "important" you speak of? What are the goals
             at which the humans of the Culture fail, and why do you
             believe that not only are they failing, but that you would
             fail if placed in the same setting?

             I don't like how they favor drug use over proper Fun, but I
             find their drug use largely unobjectionable and stupid
             since I, placed in the same setting, could just go ahead
             and have proper Fun.

             Progress? Yes, any kind of proper Fun includes progression,
             growing as a person.

             Control? You are already but a pet of civilization, and
             your very dreams of "independence" or "freedom" are molded
             out of slaveholders sublimated revulsion at their own
             actions towards their human property. Interdependence is a
             simple ecological fact you cannot ever get away from, and I
             don't see why you *want* to.

             Equality, and the dignity of being *one of* the most
             powerful interdependent components in the civilization?
             Yeah, sure. That aspect of the Culture could definitely be
             improved. But that's heavy transhumanism: giving humans
             superhuman powers before we are wise enough to handle them
             is almost guaranteed to muck things up.

             "Really matters"? What is that, in this universe of atoms
             where the Sun is just another star?

     There is really only one god above all of these other gods. His
     name is Death. And there's only one prayer we offer to Death: Not
     today.

     I suppose if we craft our own transhumanist/FAI god, this god might
     be powerful enough to take on Death. And in some strange eon even
     Death may die, taking Chthulu et al. with him.

         ...Yeah, come to think of it, Pacific Rim is totally a
         religious text about the triumph of Elua.

         I mean, it isn't, but it *is*.

         Confession: I have grown to dislike *so many things* about nerd
         culture, but this in particular has really grown old. The whole
         "HFY" thing ought to have been a passing trend, peaking with
         something like the Gurren Lagann movies. I get that it was
         itself an overreaction to the blandness of humans-as-default,
         but now I feel that it's just derp.

         Settings with galactic-scale conflicts that I like, from
         Warhammer 40k to Sword of The Stars (play it!), manage to make
         humans interesting special snowflakes while retaining some, I
         dunno, sense of *balance*, not just semi-arbitrary
         circlejerking.

         (Ok, so the humans in SoTS might not be that unique in terms of
         design -- the whole canon is really ambiguious, so you can
         never tell how much of a scrappy underdog vs. big expansionist
         empire they're supposed to be -- but they are very much a
         "challenging" faction rather than a "default" one in gameplay.
         End entirely irrelevant digression.)

             *really grown old*

             I this is sort of failing to miss the point in the case of
             Pacific Rim, which was clearly intended as an appeal to
             nostalgia among a certain demographic. Even some of the
             flaws of the film were clearly intentional nods to genre.

                 I'm talking 80% not about the media but about the
                 fandom and the general annoying (to me) attitude that
                 it feeds through osmosis. Really, people you can have a
                 thousand different varieties of "It's cool and neat to
                 be human" (like, on the low-power/high-squishy end, the
                 nerve-wracking narratives generated by X-Com; no, not
                 the godawful newfangled one, the 1994 one) without
                 going ZOMG I PUNCH ALEINS WITH MY DONGER LOL, ALL I
                 NEED IS \[MURICA/日本\].

                 The Salvation War thing was just an especially
                 obnoxious recent offender.

     In some ways, Scott's proposal here seems to me an inversion of the
     classic Christian story. Scott wants to kill the God of this world
     (= Satan), whereas the Christian God triumphed over Satan not by
     killing him but by letting himself be killed by Satan in order to
     expose Satan for what he was --- demonic --- and break Satan's
     spell over human beings.

     The Christian ethic supports, not conquering Moloch by Moloch's own
     methods (violence and coercion), but by defeating his hold over us
     by rejecting those methods.

     Even rational individuals, in a poorly functioning group, can all
     agree to a poor outcome. It's important to openly praise those who
     hold different views, in order to avoid this failure mode.

     [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox){rel="nofollow ugc"}

     "Ronald Sims writes that the Abilene paradox is similar to
     groupthink, but differs in significant ways, including that in
     groupthink individuals are not acting contrary to their conscious
     wishes and generally feel good about the decisions the group has
     reached.\[5\] According to Sims, in the Abilene paradox, the
     individuals acting contrary to their own wishes are more likely to
     have negative feelings about the outcome. In Sims' view, groupthink
     is a psychological phenomenon affecting clarity of thought, where
     in the Abilene paradox thought is unaffected.\[6\]\
     Like groupthink theories, the Abilene paradox theory is used to
     illustrate that groups not only have problems managing
     disagreements, but that agreements may also be a problem in a
     poorly functioning group.\[7\]"

     You might be interested in my book 'The System,' posted free, as a
     pdf, on my website
     [http://www.andyturnbull.com](http://www.andyturnbull.com){rel="nofollow ugc"}.
     Essentially, it argues that the world is ruled by the metaphysical
     entities that I call "metasystems." These are real entities ---
     self-organized systems --- that are not under human control. The
     Military Industrial Complex is one well-known example.

     Reading Ginsberg's poem, I could substitute "the System" for
     "Moloch," and agree with most of what he says. The difference is
     that "moloch" is beyond human control, but if we study "the system"
     we may learn to control it.

     #Education reform:

     Google makes profits by systematically analyzing which hiring
     decisions perform well and which don't and then changing their
     hiring decisions based on the analysis.\
     I see no reason why other big corporations shouldn't also have
     incentives to do this.

     #corporate welfare:\
     You would be surprised. Plenty of people want that the government
     supports green energy through policies that equal corporate welfare
     for green energy companies. There are very few people who take a
     principled stance against government subventions and don't advocate
     for them when it serves some of their policy goals.

     Few people seriously advocate "no corporate welfare" as a schelling
     point. Most people rather argue something like "no bad corporate
     welfare".

     I don't think I can tell you how much this post means to me while
     maintaining a reasonable comment length. I will only say that this
     is something I've thought about for a long time, even using the
     name "Moloch" myself in my daily journal. One thing we can take
     comfort from is that this feature of the universe is becoming more
     apparent to more and more people, to the point where the concept
     obviously clicked with the hundreds of readers here.

     I think your offhand comment about how similar observations likely
     shaped Marxism are interesting, and that you should look into the
     philosophy more. The way real-world communist governments turn from
     true communism to something that better fits governmental
     incentives is itself an illustration of the concept of Moloch, and
     a useful cautionary tale too.

     Bureaucracy can also become this type of trap, when competing
     departments gain power and funding by implementing additional
     rules, without paying their share of the true cost to the system of
     the overhead from implementing them.

     Terry Gilliam's film *Brazil* provides a vision of the end point of
     such a society, with the protagonist wishing to but failing to
     stick it to 'The Man'.

     The Malthusian scenario really seems like a different category than
     the tragedy of the commons. It's not nearly so obvious to me that
     the God's eye correct action is to avoid creating agriculture or
     what have you. If someone had the option of flipping a switch which
     would determine once and for all if agriculture is invented, they
     still might flip it because the increase in carrying capacity is of
     sufficient benefit. Values may be sacrificed, but people sacrifice
     values because the tradeoff seems worth it.

     The caterpillars are also in a radically different situation than
     women under patriarchy. The caterpillars have every genetic
     interest in avoiding parasitation, women do not have such an
     interest in avoiding bearing lots of children.

         *The Malthusian scenario really seems like a different category
         than the tragedy of the commons.*

         Wasn't the original Tragedy of the Commons essay in part about
         the Malthusian scenario, or do I misunderstand you?

         *The caterpillars have every genetic interest in avoiding
         parasitation, women do not have such an interest in avoiding
         bearing lots of children.*

         If one high-quality offspring will get many mating
         opportunities, and many low-quality offspring will together get
         few or none (perhaps by not surviving to adulthood), women (and
         men) may well have a genetic interest in having fewer
         offspring. If you see a species where multiple individuals are
         required to provide the calories needed to raise a child (e.g.
         humans, many bird species), limitations on family size are
         often also seen for the same reason.

     *art and music and philosophy and love*

     These are what you're most afraid of losing to merciless
     evolutionary and economic competition, but these are the only
     things that *won't* be lost. In merciless competition, these are
     what show you who the winners are; these are what show you who you
     should mate with when competition is fiercest and inequality is
     highest. Art and music and philosophy and love are the only things
     that a corrupt aristocracy does right. They won't go away even when
     the grinding is at its grindiest, because they're what show you who
     is and isn't ground.

         An illustration: Europe's foundling homes were a literal
         Moloch. Millions of infants were left to die in them. The one
         reliable service that they provided was baptism, a final
         commitment to a god before death.

         The first major foundling home was commissioned in Florence in
         1419, and opened in 1445. First hundreds of children were left
         there every year, then thousands. In 1640, 22% of all babies
         born in Florence were left at the Innocenti. Between 1500 and
         1700, the number never dropped below 12%. (Later, in the worst
         years, in the 1840s, that number went up to 43%.)

         That's not the percentage that died; that's the percentage of
         *all babies born* in Florence that were left at foundling
         homes. In the early years, the 1460s, chances for survival were
         reasonably good; only 5 in 10 died. By the 1480s, 8 or 9 in 10
         died. Mortality rates remained staggering for the next three
         centuries. If you meet an Esposito -- an "exposed one" --
         you're meeting the descendant of one of the lucky survivors of
         an Italian temple to Moloch. And Florence was only the first of
         many; after Florence, foundling homes spread first across
         Italy, then Europe. "Millions of children" is not hyperbole,
         but a fact meticulously recorded in the registers of
         admittance, baptism, and death.

         What happened to the art of Florence during this reign of
         Moloch? Let's make a list: Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli,
         Michelangelo, Ghirlandaio, Verrocchio. A golden age.
         Brunelleschi himself designed the Innocenti.

         Art has nothing to fear from Moloch.

         Nor music, poetry, literature. Vienna's foundling home opened
         in 1784, the year that Mozart met Haydn there. Catherine the
         Great's reign saw the opening of foundling homes in Moscow and
         St. Petersburg, along with a flowering of patronage of artists
         and scientists. Everywhere you look, the same people are
         patronizing temples to Moloch and beautiful art. They are both
         symptoms of the same inequality: The grinding down of most of
         the population alongside the glittering uplifting of a few.

         If you want to learn more, information on foundling homes come
         from "Mother Nature" by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, an excellent book
         if you want to learn about the darkest side of human evolution,
         and from "Abandoned Children", edited by Catherine Panter-Brick
         and Malcolm T. Smith.

             Just to be fair, and the answer is probably in the books,
             but ... what happened to unwanted children \*before\* the
             foundling homes, and was that any better?

                 That's a very interesting question, and I don't know
                 the answer to it. We do know that the silk guild was
                 given the responsibility to take care of abandoned
                 children before 1300, so there were obviously some
                 abandoned children, and some effort to take care of
                 them. But was the increased action in the 1400s the
                 result of an increase in children abandoned on the
                 street, or an increase in how much Florentines cared
                 about them? As far as I know, the numbers aren't
                 available to say anything definitive one way or another
                 about the pre-1400 situation.

                 Looking forward from 1400, though, we do have better
                 information, and we know that the problem got
                 progressively worse across Western Europe over the next
                 few centuries. It was tied to the development of wet
                 nursing, another Molochian nightmare. Crudely sketched,
                 the system at its dystopian height went like this: The
                 rich would pump out babies as quickly as they could,
                 with relatively good survival rates. This was made
                 possible by immediately farming out their children to
                 closely supervised wet nurses.

                 The wet nurses themselves were obviously mothers. The
                 result of becoming wet nurses was that their rates of
                 fertility were lower (because they were breastfeeding
                 rich children for long periods), and the survival rates
                 of their own children were worse (because they had to
                 send their own infants out to very poor, poorly
                 supervised wet nurses at the very bottom of the social
                 scale).

                 The wet nurses at the very bottom often had to abandon
                 their own infants, because they needed wet nursing cash
                 to stay alive themselves and didn't have anything left
                 over to raise children of their own. At best -- as in
                 Florence -- their infants at least had a beautiful
                 building to die in.

                 This stretched across the same time period (1400-1900
                 at the outside, 1500-1800 on the inside) when art,
                 music and poetry were at their classical heights. Which
                 leads to another question: Was the obsessive focus on
                 beauty in the high art of the period somehow related to
                 the ugliness of the social system? It does seem like a
                 striking contrast, doesn't it?

     I don't know if I'll ever get around to writing a thorough comment
     because I feel an obligation to read all the previous comments
     first, but the quotes from Rao get at an important distinction
     among the things we might want to protect from Moloch-- play vs.

     There is a curious inverse parallel between your reasons why Moloch
     does not bring us all the way to the hell (excess resources,
     physical limitations, utility maximization, coordination) and
     chapter "Constraints on perfection" in Dawkins' "The extended
     phenotype".

     Allow me to summarize this chapter here:

     There are several main reasons why adoptionism (belief that all
     aspects of morphology, physiology and behavior are adaptive optimal
     solutions to the problems) is not entirely true:\
     -- Time lags (between environmental changes and reactive
     adaptations).\
     -- Historical constraints (laryngeal nerve of a giraffe).\
     -- Available genetic variation. It affects not only possibility of
     a particular change, but also rate of evolution. It's (at least,
     theoretically) possible that selection pressure will lead you to
     suboptimal adaptation (even when variations for a better one
     available) just because you move towards it faster.\
     -- Constraints of costs and materials.\
     -- Imperfections at one level due to selection at another (as a
     special case, eponymous selfishness).\
     -- Mistakes due to environmental unpredictability and malevolence
     (somebody else manipulating you).

     That's very thought-provoking -- although I'm not sure the
     fish-farm parable works, even as an argument against full-blown
     anarchism. Wouldn't a consumer boycott work if applied to polluting
     fish-farms? Perhaps spread by a facebook meme...

     Alternatively, a large fishmeal manufacturer (let's say) which
     needed supplies from a large number of farms, and which would lose
     more from a lack of supply than it would gain from cheap fish
     (which, if supply dried up, would rapidly become expensive fish).
     Or the other fish farmers could ostracize a non-cooperator -- there
     are few market economies so 'pure' that social capital can be
     ignored.

     In practice, the 'good' fish farmers would probably sue the 'bad'
     one. This could happen in a variety of societies, including
     capitalist ones, but not necessarily in a society where the
     fish-farms all belonged to the state; the government might be
     powerful enough to intervene, but those in charge might still lack
     incentives to do so.

     One advantage of accumulating excess wealth is that it allows
     consumers to disregard the price of coffee-beans, to an extent, if
     it allows them to indulge their taste-buds or signal their virtue
     by buying 'fair trade' coffee, something that many Americans but
     few Ethiopians can afford to do.
